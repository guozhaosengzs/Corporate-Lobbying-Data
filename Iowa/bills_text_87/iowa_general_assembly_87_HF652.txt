 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 27 24    1.  It is the intent of the general assembly and the purposes
 27 25 of this subsection that the increased revenues to the general

 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 27 25 of this subsection that the increased revenues to the general
 27 26 fund of the state resulting from the provisions of this Act, as
 27 27 estimated by the department of revenue, shall be transferred
 27 28 for a period of time to the cash reserve fund created in
 27 29 section 8.56 and the taxpayers trust fund created in section
 27 30 8.57E and, to that end, the following transfers shall be made:
 27 31    a.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending
 27 32 June 30, 2018, there is transferred from the general fund of
 27 33 the state to the cash reserve fund created in section 8.56,

 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI

 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 27 26 fund of the state resulting from the provisions of this Act, as
 27 27 estimated by the department of revenue, shall be transferred
 27 28 for a period of time to the cash reserve fund created in
 27 29 section 8.56 and the taxpayers trust fund created in section
 27 30 8.57E and, to that end, the following transfers shall be made:
 27 31    a.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending
 27 32 June 30, 2018, there is transferred from the general fund of
 27 33 the state to the cash reserve fund created in section 8.56,

 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 27 27 estimated by the department of revenue, shall be transferred
 27 28 for a period of time to the cash reserve fund created in
 27 29 section 8.56 and the taxpayers trust fund created in section
 27 30 8.57E and, to that end, the following transfers shall be made:
 27 31    a.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending
 27 32 June 30, 2018, there is transferred from the general fund of
 27 33 the state to the cash reserve fund created in section 8.56,
 27 34 seven million three hundred fifty=eight thousand three hundred

 28  3 the state to the tax expenditure limitation account in the
 28  4 taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E, thirty=three
 28  5 million five hundred six thousand eight hundred fifteen
 28  6 dollars.
 28  7    c.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019, and ending

 28 15 fund of the state to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 16 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E, sixty=five
 28 17 million two hundred thirteen thousand thirty=seven dollars.
 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the

 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 27 28 for a period of time to the cash reserve fund created in
 27 29 section 8.56 and the taxpayers trust fund created in section
 27 30 8.57E and, to that end, the following transfers shall be made:
 27 31    a.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending
 27 32 June 30, 2018, there is transferred from the general fund of
 27 33 the state to the cash reserve fund created in section 8.56,

 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the

 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the

 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 27 30 8.57E and, to that end, the following transfers shall be made:
 27 31    a.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and ending
 27 32 June 30, 2018, there is transferred from the general fund of

 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a

 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II

 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the

 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II

 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the

 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code

 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These

 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a

 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the

 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust

 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the

 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the

 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's

 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting

 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II

 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel

 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by

 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount

 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.

 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.

 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II

 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the

 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an

 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under

 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the

 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND

 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes

 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described

 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust

 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II

 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified

 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 14 ending June 30, 2021, there is transferred from the general
 28 15 fund of the state to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 16 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E, sixty=five
 28 17 million two hundred thirteen thousand thirty=seven dollars.
 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant

 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying

 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying

 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.

 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II

 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the

 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax

 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 13    d.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020, and
 28 14 ending June 30, 2021, there is transferred from the general
 28 15 fund of the state to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 16 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E, sixty=five
 28 17 million two hundred thirteen thousand thirty=seven dollars.
 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 14 ending June 30, 2021, there is transferred from the general
 28 15 fund of the state to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 16 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E, sixty=five
 28 17 million two hundred thirteen thousand thirty=seven dollars.
 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be

 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the

 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 17 million two hundred thirteen thousand thirty=seven dollars.
 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the

 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the

 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the

 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

       mm/sc/rj
 28 18    2.  It is the intent of the general assembly that the
 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 19 increased revenues to the general fund of the state resulting
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on

 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 20 from the provisions of this Act in fiscal years beginning on
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by

 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 21 or after July 1, 2021, shall, at a future time, be estimated
 28 22 by the department of revenue and transferred by an Act of the
 28 23 general assembly to the tax expenditure limitation account in
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 24 the taxpayers trust fund created in section 8.57E.
 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 25                           EXPLANATION
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

       mm/sc/rj
 28 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by

 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.

 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in

 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 28    This bill relates to state revenue and finance by modifying
 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 29 numerous tax credits and tax credit programs and providing for
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply

 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 30 transfers to the cash reserve fund and the taxpayers trust
 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by

 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying

 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the

 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 28 31 fund.
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

       mm/sc/rj
 28 32    DIVISION I == BEGINNING FARMER TAX CREDITS.  Division
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II

 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 33 I reduces the tax credit rates of the agricultural assets
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 34 transfer tax credit in Code section 16.80 from 7 percent to
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax

 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 28 35 6 percent of the gross amount paid to a taxpayer pursuant
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the

 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29  1 to an agricultural assets transfer agreement that includes a
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the

 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29  2 lease on a cash basis, and from 17 percent to 16 percent of
 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87

 29  3 the amount paid to the taxpayer under an agricultural assets
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the

 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29  4 transfer agreement that includes a lease on a commodity share
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by

 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available

 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through

 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29  5 basis.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29  6 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29  7 or after that date.
 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax

 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 29  8    The current agricultural assets transfer tax credit program
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29  9 is scheduled under current law to be substantially modified
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply

 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the

 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail

 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.

 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 10 beginning on January 1, 2018, and the division reduces the
 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's

 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an

 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the

 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 29 11 tax credit rates under that modified program from 5 percent
 29 12 to 4.5 percent of the amount paid under an agreement, or from
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the

 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 13 15 percent to 14 percent of the amount paid for the sale of
 29 14 crops or animals for certain agreements in which the payment
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 15 is exclusively made from the sale of crops or animals.  These
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 16 changes take effect January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 17 beginning on or after that date.
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 18    The division also reduces the tax credit rates of the custom
 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 29 19 farming contract tax credit from 7 percent to 6 percent of the
 29 20 gross amount paid to the qualified beginning farmer under a
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by

 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 21 contract.  These changes take effect upon enactment and apply
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 22 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 23 or after that date.
 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four

 29 24    DIVISIONS II THROUGH V ==== FUEL TAX CREDITS.  Divisions II
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies

 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 25 through V make several changes to the biodiesel blended fuel
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the

 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 26 tax credit under Code section 422.11P, the E=15 plus gasoline
 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 29 27 promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11Y, the E=85
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change

 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 28 gasoline promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11O, and
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

       mm/sc/rj
 29 29 the ethanol promotion tax credit under Code section 422.11N
 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 29 30 (collectively referred to as the "fuel tax credits").
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill

 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's

 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 31    Under current law, the fuel tax credits have no limit on
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 32 the aggregate amounts that may be claimed annually.  The bill
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 29 33 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits that may
 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 29 34 be claimed to $16 million per calendar year for the biodiesel
 29 35 blended fuel tax credit, to $430,200 per calendar year for the
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND

 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply

 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the

 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in

 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 30  1 E=15 plus gasoline promotion tax credit, to $2,511,100 per
 30  2 calendar year for the E=85 gasoline promotion tax credit, and
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.

 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail

 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 30  3 to $1,071,500 per calendar year for the ethanol promotion tax
 30  4 credit.
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 30  5    Under current law, the fuel tax credits are all administered
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended
 31  3 gasoline sold on or after that date.
 31  4    DIVISION VI ==== HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL AND
 31  5 ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT TAX CREDIT.  Division VI reduces the
 31  6 tax credit rate of the historic preservation and cultural and
 31  7 entertainment district tax credit in Code chapter 404A from 25
 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 30  6 in a substantially similar manner and provide that a tax credit
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 30  7 may be claimed by any retail dealer who meets the statutory
 30  8 requirements on a fiscal year or calendar year basis, depending
 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  8 percent to 15 percent of a qualified rehabilitation project's
 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.
 31 15    DIVISION VII ==== SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or

 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits

 30  9 on the tax year of the retail dealer.  The bill provides
 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner

 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code

 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply

 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30 10 that the fuel tax credits shall be calculated on a calendar
 30 11 year basis, and requires a retail dealer to submit an annual
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes

 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's

 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount

 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any

 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies

 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 30 12 application to the department of revenue (DOR) in the manner
 30 13 and form prescribed by DOR.  DOR is allowed to establish an
 30 14 application deadline or to require a retail dealer to apply
 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply
 30 35 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31  1 or after that date, and for biodiesel blended fuel, qualifying
 31  2 ethanol blended gasoline, E=85 gasoline, or ethanol blended

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the
 31 12 amount of tax credits that may be awarded each fiscal year by
 31 13 the economic development authority (EDA).  This change takes
 31 14 effect July 1, 2017.

 31 16 VII reduces the tax credit rate of the solar energy system tax
 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent
 31 18 of the applicable federal energy tax credits available for the
 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the

 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate

 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for

 31 17 credit in Code section 422.11L from 50 percent to 40 percent

 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available

 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30 15 for the fuel tax credits on or in conjunction with the retail
 30 16 dealer's annual motor fuel gallonage report required under Code
 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations

 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the

 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,

 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.

 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30 17 section 452A.33.  The bill requires DOR to issue tax credit
 30 18 certificates to retail dealers for qualifying fuel tax credits,
 30 19 which tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 30 20 bill to claim the applicable fuel tax credit.  If the aggregate
 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any
 30 33 period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
 30 34    Divisions II through V take effect upon enactment and apply

 31 19 installation of certain solar energy property.  This change
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division

 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described

 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's

 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under

 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,

 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit
 30 23 described above, DOR is required to reduce all tax credit
 30 24 claims for that fuel tax credit in a prorated fashion until the
 30 25 aggregate tax credit claims equal the applicable maximum amount
 30 26 described above.
 30 27    The bill includes transition provisions for a retail dealer
 30 28 with a fiscal tax year that apply to the retail dealer's
 30 29 2016=2017 tax year and that, in general, require a retail
 30 30 dealer to calculate a fuel tax credit under current law for
 30 31 that portion of the tax year that covers 2016, and then under
 30 32 the applicable Code sections as amended in the bill for any

 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 30 21 amount of fuel tax credit claims for a calendar year for any
 30 22 particular fuel tax credit exceeds the applicable maximum limit

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in

 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in

 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that

 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in

 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July

 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits

 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division

 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is

 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division

 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in

 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity

 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 31  9 expenditures.  This change applies to qualified rehabilitation
 31 10 projects registered on or after July 1, 2017.
 31 11    The division also reduces from $45 million to $35 million the

 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five

 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high

 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed

 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces

 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the

 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through

 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four

 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list

 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits

 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying

 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list

 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 31 20 takes effect upon enactment and applies to installations
 31 21 occurring on or after that date.
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.

 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division

 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is

 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 31 22    The division also reduces from $5 million to $4 million
 31 23 the cumulative value of tax credits that may be claimed
 31 24 annually.  This change takes effect upon enactment and applies
 31 25 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 31 26 or after that date.
 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.

 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This

 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes

 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 27    DIVISION VIII ==== GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP TAX CREDIT.  Division
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 31 28 VIII reduces the tax credit rate of the geothermal heat pump
 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 31 29 tax credit in Code section 422.11I from 20 percent to 16
 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 31 30 percent of the applicable federal energy tax credit available
 31 31 for the installation of certain geothermal heat pump property.
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division

 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This

 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 31 32    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 31 33 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87
       mm/sc/rj
 31 34 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 31 35 year to $376,020, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR to
 32  1 receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code

 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the

 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is

 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.

 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 32  2 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32  3 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies
 32 16 retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on
 32 17 or after that date.
 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code

 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections

 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 32  4 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32  5 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the
 32  6 annual limit ($376,020) is reached, and establishes a wait
 32  7 list for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 32  8 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 32  9 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 32 10 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 32 11 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 32 12 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 32 13 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 32 14 division to claim the geothermal heat pump tax credit.
 32 15    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies

 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five

 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the

 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND

 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund

 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four

 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code

 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80

 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 32 18    DIVISION IX ==== GEOTHERMAL TAX CREDIT.  Division IX reduces
 32 19 the tax credit rate of the geothermal tax credit in Code
 32 20 section 422.10A from 10 percent to 8 percent of a taxpayer's
 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 32 21 qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures.  This
 32 22 change takes effect upon enactment and applies to qualified
 32 23 geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on or
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of

 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

       mm/sc/rj
 32 24 after that date.
 32 25    Under current law, there is no limit on the aggregate amount
 32 26 of tax credits that may be claimed annually.  The division
 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI

 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section

 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections

 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be
 32 30 filed by May 1 following the calendar year of the qualified
 32 31 geothermal heat pump property installation.  The division
 32 32 requires DOR to issue tax credit certificates to qualifying
 32 33 taxpayers on a first=come, first=served basis until the annual
 32 34 limit ($1.5 million) is reached, and establishes a wait list
 32 35 for qualifying taxpayers who do not receive a tax credit
 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87

 32 27 limits the maximum aggregate amount of tax credits per calendar
 32 28 year to $1.5 million, and requires a taxpayer to apply to DOR
 32 29 to receive the tax credit.  The tax credit application must be

 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes

 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,

 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount

 33  1 certificate because the tax credit limit has been reached.
 33  2 Taxpayers shall be placed on the wait list in the order the
 33  3 applications are received and shall be given priority for
 33  4 receiving a tax credit certificate in a future year, contingent
 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect

 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS

 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,

 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during

 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made

 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33  5 on the availability of tax credits in that particular year.
 33  6 Tax credit certificates may be used as described in the
 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax

 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33  7 division to claim the geothermal tax credit.  These provisions
 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.
       LSB 2629HV (3) 87

 33  8 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 33  9 1, 2017, for tax years beginning on or after that date, and
 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on
 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33 10 for geothermal heat pump property installations occurring on

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33 11 or after that date.
 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33 12    DIVISION X ==== INNOVATION FUND TAX CREDIT.  Division X reduces
 33 13 the tax credit rate of the innovation fund tax credit in Code
 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR
 36  8 and transferred by an Act of the general assembly to the tax
 36  9 expenditure limitation account within the taxpayers trust fund.

 33 14 section 15E.52 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 15 equity investment in an innovation fund.  The division takes
 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers

 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 33 16 effect upon enactment and applies to equity investments in an
 33 17 innovation fund made on or after that date.
 33 18    DIVISION XI ==== ANGEL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT.  Division XI
 33 19 reduces the tax credit rate of the tax credit for investments
 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's
 33 22 equity investment.  The division takes effect upon enactment
 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
 35 28    DIVISION XIV ==== TRANSFERS TO CASH RESERVE FUND AND TAXPAYERS
 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax

 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash

 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount

 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described

 33 20 in a qualifying business (angel investor tax credit) in Code
 33 21 section 15E.43 from 25 percent to 20 percent of a taxpayer's

 33 23 and applies to equity investments in a qualifying business made
 33 24 on or after that date.
 33 25    DIVISION XII ==== RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TAX CREDIT.  Division
 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the
 33 30 corporate income tax (Code section 422.33(5)), the division
 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and
 33 34 1.95 percents to 3.85 and 1.61 percents, respectively.  These
 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the

 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 33 26 XII makes several changes to the research activities tax
 33 27 credits under Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33(5).
 33 28    With regard to the research activities tax credits available
 33 29 under the individual income tax (Code section 422.10) and the

 33 31 reduces the tax credit rate for the regular calculation method
 33 32 from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent, and the tax credit rates for
 33 33 the alternative simplified calculation method from 4.55 and

 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is

 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,

 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,

 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the

 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 33 35 changes take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to
 34  1 January 1, 2017, for tax years ending on or after that date.
 34  2    Under current law, any research activities tax credit in
 34  3 excess of a taxpayer's tax liability is refundable to the
 34  4 taxpayer.  The division provides that research activities tax
 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.
 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer

 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect

 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum
 35 16 amount of high quality jobs program tax credits that may be
 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July
 35 19 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2021.  The division provides that
 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or
 35 25 after July 1, 2022, the maximum amount of high quality jobs
 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.

 35 29 TRUST FUND.  Division XIV makes various transfers for four
 35 30 fiscal years of the estimated increased revenues from the tax
 35 31 credit changes in the bill.  For FY 2017=2018, the division
 35 32 transfers $7,358,352 from the general fund to the cash
 35 33 reserve fund created in Code section 8.56.  For FY 2018=2019,
 35 34 FY 2019=2020, and FY 2020=2021, the division transfers
 35 35 $33,506,815, $57,693,141, and $65,213,037, respectively, from
 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the
 36  5 general assembly that the increased revenues from the tax
 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 34  5 credits will no longer be refundable for tax years ending on
 34  6 or after January 1, 2018, unless the taxpayer is considered
 34  7 a new claimant, but any excess may be carried forward for up
 34  8 to eight years.  The division defines "new claimant" to be an
 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five
 34 12 tax years beginning with the first tax year for which the
 34 13 entity earns a research activities tax credit.  However, an
 34 14 entity shall not be considered a new claimant if the entity is
 34 15 an affiliate of an entity that does not qualify or no longer
 34 16 qualifies as a new claimant.  "Affiliate" is defined in the
 34 17 division.
 34 18    Research activities tax credits claimed by an individual or
 34 19 entity which credits were received from another pass=through
 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new
 34 22 claimant.
 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded
 34 29 on or after the enactment date of the bill.

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 17 awarded per fiscal year from $105 million to $65 million for
 35 18 each fiscal year of the four=year fiscal period beginning July

 35 20 the maximum amount of high quality jobs program tax credits
 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 36  1 the general fund of the state to a tax expenditure limitation
 36  2 account created in the division within the taxpayers trust fund
 36  3 created in Code section 8.57E.
 36  4    The division also provides that it is the intent of the

 36  6 credit changes in the bill in fiscal years beginning on or
 36  7 after July 1, 2022, shall, in the future, be estimated by DOR

 34  9 entity that did not earn a research activities tax credit for
 34 10 a tax year ending on or before January 1, 2014.  A qualifying
 34 11 entity shall be considered a new claimant for a period of five

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that
 34 25 date.  However, the provisions relating to the refundability of
 34 26 the supplemental research activities tax credits (Code section
 34 27 15.335) awarded by EDA under the high quality jobs program
 34 28 apply to supplemental research activities tax credits awarded

 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum
 35  8 aggregate tax credit limit are also subject to annual tax
 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described

 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,

 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35  9 credit award limits, including the redevelopment tax credit
 35 10 program in Code sections 15.293A and 15.293B and the high
 35 11 quality jobs program administered pursuant to Code sections
 35 12 15.326 through 15.336.  The division reduces the maximum amount
 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal

 34 20 entity shall not be considered refundable unless the entity
 34 21 that ultimately earned the tax credit qualified as a new

 34 23    These provisions relating to refundability take effect
 34 24 January 1, 2018, and apply to tax years ending on or after that

 34 30    DIVISION XIII ==== ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROGRAMS AND
 34 31 AGGREGATE TAX CREDIT LIMIT.  Current law in Code section 15.119
 34 32 limits to $170 million the amount of tax credits that may
 34 33 be awarded by EDA per fiscal year under certain EDA programs
 34 34 (maximum aggregate tax credit limit).  EDA may award up to 20
 34 35 percent more tax credits than that amount during a fiscal year,
 35  1 but the excess is counted against the maximum aggregate tax
 35  2 credit limit for the next fiscal year.  The bill decreases the
 35  3 maximum aggregate tax credit limit from $170 million to $128
 35  4 million and strikes EDA's ability to exceed that amount during
 35  5 a fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 35  6 2017.
 35  7    Also under current law, the programs under EDA's maximum

 35 13 of redevelopment tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal
 35 14 year from $10 million to $8 million for fiscal years beginning
 35 15 on or after July 1, 2017.  The division reduces the maximum

 35 21 that may be awarded for FY 2021=2022 will be $65 million if
 35 22 the renewable chemical tax credit allocation limit described
 35 23 in Code section 15.119(2)(a)(3) is satisfied, or will be $80
 35 24 million if not satisfied.  For fiscal years beginning on or

 35 26 program tax credits that may be awarded per fiscal year shall
 35 27 be $80 million.
