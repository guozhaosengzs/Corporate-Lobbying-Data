  4  6    This chapter does not apply to any of the following:
  4  7    1.  The production, processing, labeling, or marketing of
  4  8 milk, if the milk is produced by a person operating a dairy
  4  9 farm in compliance with section 192.145.
  4 10    2.  The manufacturing, labeling, or marketing of a milk
  4 11 product or dairy product, if the milk product or dairy
  4 12 product is manufactured by a person operating a dairy farm in
  4 13 compliance with section 192.145.
  4 14                           EXPLANATION
  4 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 17     BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill provides that a person who
  4 18 operates a dairy farm (operator) may produce and dispose of
  4 19 the milk produced on the dairy farm, process such milk, or
  4 20 manufacture a milk product or dairy product (product) from such
  4 21 milk without state regulation under certain circumstances.
  4 22 Generally, a "milk product" includes items such as cream, sour
  4 23 cream, eggnog, or buttermilk for which temperature is an issue,
  4 24 but may not include other dairy items such as butter or cheese.
  4 25 The bill defines a "dairy product" as a manufactured item other
  4 26 than a milk product in which milk is the principal ingredient.
  4 27 The operator may sell the milk or product, regardless of
  4 28 whether the milk or product is unpasteurized or ungraded, so
  4 29 long as it is sold to an individual on a retail basis and not
  4 30 for resale.  The operator may also deliver the milk or product
  4 31 to a location specified by the individual.  A person purchasing
  4 32 the milk or product is prohibited from reselling the milk or
  4 33 product.  The operator is also not subject to state regulations
  4 34 governing the production, processing, labeling, or marketing
  4 35 of milk or the manufacturing, labeling, or marketing of a milk
  5  1 product to the extent that the operator is acting in compliance
  5  2 with the bill's provisions.
  5  3     BACKGROUND.  Dairy production and the manufacture of milk
  5  4 and dairy products are governed under federal and state law
  5  5 including by the United States food and drug administration
  5  6 (FDA) under 21 C.F.R. pt. 1240 and the department of
  5  7 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) under Code title V,
  5  8 subtitle 4. Specifically, DALS regulates and enforces a
  5  9 number of statutory provisions governing the production of
  5 10 products, including the labeling of milk and milk products
  5 11 (Code chapter 191), the production and marketing of milk and
  5 12 products manufactured from milk (Code chapter 192), and the
  5 13 grading of milk (Code chapter 194).  This includes a number of
  5 14 departmental rules (21 IAC, chs. 68=71). DALS also regulates
  5 15 standards for dairy products (Code section 190.2 and 21 IAC ch.
  5 16 71). DALS has adopted by reference the "Grade 'A' Pasteurized
  5 17 Milk Ordinance", a body of comprehensive regulations published
  5 18 by the national conference on interstate milk shipments and the
  5 19 FDA (Code section 192.102). Under state law, all milk must
  5 20 be sold on the basis of grade (Code section 194.10) and only
  5 21 grade "A" pasteurized milk and milk products can be sold to the
  5 22 final consumer (Code section 192.103).  Grade "B" milk may be
  5 23 sold for manufacturing purposes (21 IAC 68.2).  All dairy farms
  5 24 selling grade "A" or grade "B" milk must be issued a permit (21
  5 25 IAC 68.2) and are subject to inspection (21 IAC 68.12).
  5 26     PENALTY.  A person who violates the bill's provisions is
  5 27 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189.21). A simple
  5 28 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than 30
  5 29 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or by
  5 30 both.

  4 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 17     BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill provides that a person who
  4 18 operates a dairy farm (operator) may produce and dispose of
  4 19 the milk produced on the dairy farm, process such milk, or
  4 20 manufacture a milk product or dairy product (product) from such
  4 21 milk without state regulation under certain circumstances.
  4 22 Generally, a "milk product" includes items such as cream, sour
  4 23 cream, eggnog, or buttermilk for which temperature is an issue,
  4 24 but may not include other dairy items such as butter or cheese.
  4 25 The bill defines a "dairy product" as a manufactured item other
  4 26 than a milk product in which milk is the principal ingredient.
  4 27 The operator may sell the milk or product, regardless of
  4 28 whether the milk or product is unpasteurized or ungraded, so
  4 29 long as it is sold to an individual on a retail basis and not
  4 30 for resale.  The operator may also deliver the milk or product
  4 31 to a location specified by the individual.  A person purchasing
  4 32 the milk or product is prohibited from reselling the milk or
  4 33 product.  The operator is also not subject to state regulations
  4 34 governing the production, processing, labeling, or marketing
  4 35 of milk or the manufacturing, labeling, or marketing of a milk
  5  1 product to the extent that the operator is acting in compliance
  5  2 with the bill's provisions.
  5  3     BACKGROUND.  Dairy production and the manufacture of milk
  5  4 and dairy products are governed under federal and state law
  5  5 including by the United States food and drug administration
  5  6 (FDA) under 21 C.F.R. pt. 1240 and the department of
  5  7 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) under Code title V,
  5  8 subtitle 4. Specifically, DALS regulates and enforces a
  5  9 number of statutory provisions governing the production of
  5 10 products, including the labeling of milk and milk products
  5 11 (Code chapter 191), the production and marketing of milk and
  5 12 products manufactured from milk (Code chapter 192), and the
  5 13 grading of milk (Code chapter 194).  This includes a number of
  5 14 departmental rules (21 IAC, chs. 68=71). DALS also regulates
  5 15 standards for dairy products (Code section 190.2 and 21 IAC ch.
  5 16 71). DALS has adopted by reference the "Grade 'A' Pasteurized
  5 17 Milk Ordinance", a body of comprehensive regulations published
  5 18 by the national conference on interstate milk shipments and the
  5 19 FDA (Code section 192.102). Under state law, all milk must
  5 20 be sold on the basis of grade (Code section 194.10) and only
  5 21 grade "A" pasteurized milk and milk products can be sold to the
  5 22 final consumer (Code section 192.103).  Grade "B" milk may be
  5 23 sold for manufacturing purposes (21 IAC 68.2).  All dairy farms
  5 24 selling grade "A" or grade "B" milk must be issued a permit (21
  5 25 IAC 68.2) and are subject to inspection (21 IAC 68.12).
  5 26     PENALTY.  A person who violates the bill's provisions is
  5 27 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189.21). A simple
  5 28 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than 30
  5 29 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or by

  5  5 including by the United States food and drug administration
  5  6 (FDA) under 21 C.F.R. pt. 1240 and the department of
  5  7 agriculture and land stewardship (DALS) under Code title V,
  5  8 subtitle 4. Specifically, DALS regulates and enforces a
  5  9 number of statutory provisions governing the production of
  5 10 products, including the labeling of milk and milk products
  5 11 (Code chapter 191), the production and marketing of milk and
  5 12 products manufactured from milk (Code chapter 192), and the
  5 13 grading of milk (Code chapter 194).  This includes a number of
  5 14 departmental rules (21 IAC, chs. 68=71). DALS also regulates
  5 15 standards for dairy products (Code section 190.2 and 21 IAC ch.
  5 16 71). DALS has adopted by reference the "Grade 'A' Pasteurized
  5 17 Milk Ordinance", a body of comprehensive regulations published
  5 18 by the national conference on interstate milk shipments and the
  5 19 FDA (Code section 192.102). Under state law, all milk must
  5 20 be sold on the basis of grade (Code section 194.10) and only
  5 21 grade "A" pasteurized milk and milk products can be sold to the
  5 22 final consumer (Code section 192.103).  Grade "B" milk may be
  5 23 sold for manufacturing purposes (21 IAC 68.2).  All dairy farms
  5 24 selling grade "A" or grade "B" milk must be issued a permit (21
  5 25 IAC 68.2) and are subject to inspection (21 IAC 68.12).
  5 26     PENALTY.  A person who violates the bill's provisions is
  5 27 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189.21). A simple
  5 28 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than 30
  5 29 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or by
  5 30 both.
