for
the
purpose
of
financing
the
purchase
of
a
single-family
4


residence
in
this
state
by
a

“First-time

for
which
the
account’s
funds
8


are
applied.
“Single-family
residence”
is
also
defined
in
the
9


bill.
The
account
may
be

individually,
or

10


with
a
spouse
if
the

In

of

(department)
designating

These

than
April
30
of
18


the

following
the
tax
year
during

opened.
An
individual
may
establish
more
than
one
account,
20


provided
each
account
has
a
different
designated
beneficiary.
21


The
account
holder
may
change
the
designated
beneficiary
at
any
22


time,
and
may
designate
himself
or
herself
as
the
beneficiary.
23


In
addition,
an
individual
may
be
the
designated
beneficiary
24


of
more
than
one
account.
The
designated
beneficiary
must
be
25


a
first-time
homebuyer.
26


Contributions
to
an
account
may
be
made
in
the
form
of
cash
27


by
any
person
and
in
any
amount.
There
is
no
limitation
on
28


the
amount
that
may
be
retained
in
an
account.
In
addition,
29


the
account
holder
may
withdraw
funds
from
an
account
at
any
30


time.
Account
funds
shall
not
be
used
to
pay
expenses,

any,
31


of
administering
the
account,
except
that
a
service
fee
may
be

the
account
by
the
financial
institution
where
33


the
account
is
held.
The
bill
requires
an

a

of
any
federal
Internal

Service
form
1099
or
other
similar

issued

4


The
bill
provides
protection
to
financial
institutions
from
5


being
required
to
perform,
and
from
being
responsible
or
liable
6


for,
certain
activities
as
described
in
the
bill
with
respect
7


to
accounts.
The
bill
requires
the
department
to
create
the
8


forms
required
to
be
filed
by
account
holders,
and
to
adopt
9


rules
to
implement
and
administer
the
bill.
10


The
bill
provides
two
individual
income
tax
incentives
11


relating
to
the
accounts.
First,
an
account
holder
is
12


allowed
to
deduct
from
the
individual
income
tax
the
amount
of
13


contributions
made
during
the
year
by
the
account
holder
to
14


the
account
holder’s
accounts,
not
to
exceed
$2,000
per
year,
15


or
$4,000
for
married
taxpayers
with
a
joint
account.
These
16


amounts
are
adjusted
for
inflation
each
calendar
year.
Second,
17


the
bill
exempts
from
the
individual
income
tax
any
interest
18


or
earnings
received
from
the
account
holder’s
accounts.
19


The
total
amount
that
may
be
deducted
or
excluded
from
the
20


individual
income
tax
for
these
two
tax
incentives
cannot
21


exceed
an
aggregate
lifetime
limit
of
10
times
the
maximum
22


deduction
determined
above
for
the
applicable
year
($20,000
for
23


2016),
or
double
that
amount
for
married
taxpayers
with
a
joint
24


account
($40,000
for
2016).
The
account
holder’s
ability
to
25


claim
the
tax
incentives
ends
10
tax
years
after
the
tax
year
26


the
account
holder
first
opened
an
account,
or
on
the
date
when
27


account
funds
are
withdrawn
for
purposes
other
than
the
payment
28


or
reimbursement
of
the
designated
beneficiary’s
eligible
29


home
costs
in
connection
with
a
qualified
home
purchase
30


(nonqualified
withdrawal),
whichever
occurs
first.
“Eligible
31


home
costs”
and
“qualified
home
purchase”
are
both
defined
in
32


the
bill.
Amounts
transferred
between
different
accounts
of


33


the
same
account
holder
by
a
person
other
than
the
account
34


holder
are
not
considered
a
nonqualified
withdrawal
that

cause
loss
of
the
ability
to
claim
the
tax
incentives.
1


The
bill
requires
an
account
holder
to
add
to
net
income
for
2


purposes
of
calculating
the
individual
income
tax
any
amount
of
3


a
nonqualified
withdrawal
from
an
account
to
the
extent
it
was
4


previously
deducted
as
a
contribution,
but
amounts
transferred
5


between
different
accounts
of
the
same
account
holder
by
6


a
person
other
than
the
account
holder
are
not
considered
7


nonqualified
withdrawals.
In
addition,
any
amount
remaining
in
8


an
account
holder’s
account
on
January
1
of
the
10th
calendar
9


year
after
the
calendar
year
during
which
the
account
holder
10


first
opened
an
account
is
considered
to
be
a
nonqualified
11


withdrawal
that
must
be
added
to
net
income
for
the
tax
year
12


beginning
in
that
10th
year,
to
the
extent
it
was
previously
13


deducted
as
a
contribution.
Nonqualified
withdrawals
required
14


to
be
added
to
net
income
are
also
subject
to
a
penalty
equal
15


to
10
percent
of
the
nonqualified
withdrawal,
unless
the
16


withdrawal
was
made
by
reason
of
the
death
or
disability
of
the
17


account
holder,
or
was
made
pursuant
to
an
order
in
bankruptcy
18


following
a
filing
for
protection
under
the
federal
bankruptcy
19


code.
20


Finally,
the
bill
prohibits
the
amount
of
eligible
home
21


costs
in
connection
with
a
qualified
home
purchase
that
are
22


paid
or
reimbursed
from
funds
in
an
account
from
being
allowed
23


as
an
itemized
deduction
for
Iowa
individual
income
tax
24


purposes.
25


The
tax
provisions
of
the
bill
apply
to
tax
years
beginning
26


on
or
after
January
1,
2018.
