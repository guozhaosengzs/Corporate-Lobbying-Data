  2 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code section 456A.38, the lease
  2 12 to beginning farmers program, administered by the department
  2 13 of natural resources (DNR).  The bill provides that if
  2 14 possible DNR must select a veteran when leasing agricultural
  2 15 land to a qualified beginning farmer seeking to participate
  2 16 in the program.  If two or more beginning farmers who are
  2 17 veterans seek to participate in the program to lease the same
  2 18 agricultural land, DNR must select the veteran by lot.
  2 19    BACKGROUND == ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAMS.  DNR currently
  2 20 administers two related programs:  (1)  the lease to beginning
  2 21 farmers program established by statute and (2) the agricultural
  2 22 lease program established by rule. Under each program, DNR
  2 23 leases agricultural land that it holds or manages as wildlife
  2 24 habitat in each county.  Under the lease to beginning farmers
  2 25 program, DNR leases the land to a qualified beginning farmer
  2 26 certified by the Iowa finance authority (IFA) for a specific
  2 27 amount.  Under the alternative agricultural lease program, a
  2 28 participant is selected based on a bidding process. DNR first
  2 29 seeks participation from beginning farmers under the lease to
  2 30 beginning farmers program and then, if no beginning farmer
  2 31 seeks to participate in that program, or no beginning farmer is
  2 32 found qualified to participate in the program, DNR next seeks
  2 33 participation generally from persons under the agricultural
  2 34 lease program.
  2 35    BACKGROUND == QUALIFICATIONS FOR BEGINNING FARMERS AND
  3  1 VETERANS.  Generally, a beginning farmer is an individual,
  3  2 partnership, family farm corporation, or family farm limited
  3  3 liability company (Code section 16.58) with a low or moderate
  3  4 net worth as established by IFA (Code sections 16.58 and
  3  5 16.59). A veteran includes a resident of the state who
  3  6 served in the armed forces of the United States during certain
  3  7 periods of time encompassing various wars and conflicts, a
  3  8 former member of the reserve forces of the United States, a
  3  9 former member of the Iowa national guard having met certain
  3 10 conditions, and a person who served on federal active duty in
  3 11 the armed forces. In order to qualify, a person must have been
  3 12 discharged from military service under honorable conditions.
