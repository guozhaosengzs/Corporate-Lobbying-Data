special

and
other
vehicles
4


designed
to
carry
eight
or
fewer
pupils,
when
used
as
school
5


buses.
The
rules
shall
allow
pickups
designed
to
carry
nine


6

EXPLANATION
9


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
10


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
11


Currently,
rules
of
the
department
of
education
permit
12


type
III
vehicles
to
be
used
as
school
buses.
Under
281
IAC
13


44.2(5),
type
III
vehicles
are
not
regular
school
buses
but
14


are
used
to
transport
students
in
a
school-related
context
and
15


may
be
marked
as
a
school
bus.
A
type
III
vehicle
is
a
van
16


or
passenger
car,
including
a
minivan,
sport
utility
vehicle,
17


or
station
wagon.
The
difference
between
a
family
automobile
18


and
an
equivalent
type
III
vehicle
is
not
the
vehicle
itself,
19


but
rather
its
use,
as
type
III
vehicles
are
used
by
schools
20


for
purposes
of
student
transportation.
To
qualify
as
a
type
21


III
vehicle,
the
vehicle
must
carry
a
maximum
of
nine
or
fewer
22


people,
including
the
driver,
and
weigh
10,000
pounds
or
less.
23


Under
281
IAC
44.5(1),
vehicles
classified
as
pickups
are
not
24


allowed
to
be
used
for
student
transportation.
25


This
bill
requires
such
rules
to
allow
pickups
designed
26


to
carry
nine
passengers
or
less,
including
the
driver,
and
27


weighing
ten
thousand
pounds
or
less,
to
be
used
as
school
28


buses.
Under
Code
section
321.1,
a
pickup
is
any
motor
vehicle
29


designed
to
carry
merchandise
or
freight
of
any
kind,
not
to
30


exceed
2,000
pounds.
31


Under
current
law,
any
person
who
operates
or
allows
32


the
operation
of
any
vehicle
as
a
school
bus
which
does
33


not
comply
with
the
requirements
provided
by
law
or
by
the
34


rules
and
regulations
of
the
department
of
education,
or

for
which
there
is
not
a
valid
temporary

285.14).
The

of

3


all

to
4


disapprove
any

not
in
conformity
with
the
5


law
and
established
standards,
and
to
require
the
arrangements
6


to
be
altered
or
changed
so
that
they
do
conform
with
the
law
7


and
established
standards
(Code
section
285.8).
8


Under
current
law,
all
type
III
vehicles
are
prohibited
from
9


carrying
more
passengers
than
there
are
seat
belts
as
installed
10


by
the
manufacturer
(281
IAC
44.5(1)(d)).
In

trailer
11


hitches

the

allowed

be
transported
in
the
vehicle
when
the
vehicle
is
14


being
used
to
tow
(281
