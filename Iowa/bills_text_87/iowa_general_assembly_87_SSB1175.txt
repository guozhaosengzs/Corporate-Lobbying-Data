provides

commits

The

modifies
the
requirements
for
carrying
a

vehicle
on
32


land
that
is
not
owned

In
addition
33


to
carrying
a

operating
or
riding
on
a
snowmobile
or
all-terrain
vehicle,
1


with
a
loaded
pistol
or
revolver,
to
secure
the
loaded
pistol
2


or
revolver
in
a
retention
holster,
if
the
person
is
operating
3


or
riding
a
snowmobile
or
all-terrain
vehicle
on
land
that
is
4


not
owned
or
possessed
by
the
person.
5


The
bill
strikes
the
requirements
that
the
loaded
pistol
or
6


revolver
be
secured
in
a
retention
holster
and
that
a
person
7


has
in
the
person’s
possession
a
valid
permit
to
carry
weapons
8


which
has
been
issued
to
the
person,
and
act
within
the
limits
9


of
that
permit.
Thus,
the
change
in
the
bill
allows
a
person
10


operating
or
riding
on
a
snowmobile
or
all-terrain
vehicle
to
11


carry
a
loaded
pistol
or
revolver
without
a
retention
holster
12


and
without
a
permit
to
carry
weapons
as
long
as
the
person’s
13


conduct
is
otherwise
lawful.
14


The
bill
does
not
modify
the
requirement,
applicable
to
most
15


persons,
that
a
firearm,
other
than
a
pistol
or
revolver,
be
16


unloaded
and
enclosed
in
a
carrying
case
while
a
person
is
17


operating
or
riding
on
a
snowmobile
or
all-terrain
vehicle
on
18


land
that
is
not
owned
or
possessed
by
the
person.
