  5 24                           EXPLANATION
  5 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 27    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program for
  5 28 four=year=old children by establishing a preschool program
  5 29 expansion incentive and authorizing state aid for the
  5 30 incentive. The bill also addresses costs allowed under the
  5 31 program.
  5 32    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  5 33 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  5 34 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  5 35 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6  1 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.
  6  2    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6  3 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6  4 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6  5 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6  8 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6  9 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 10 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 11 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 12 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 13 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 14 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 15    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 16 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 17 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 18 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 19 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 20 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 21 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 22 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 23 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 24 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 25    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  6 26 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, July 1, 2019, and July
  6 27 1, 2020.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  6 28 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  6 29 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  6 30 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  6 31 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  6 32 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  6 33 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  6 34 preschool programming on October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015,
  6 35 and October 1, 2016.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7  1 equal to 10 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7  2 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7  3 base year.
  7  4    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7  5 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7  6 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7  7 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7  8 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7  9 the department.
  7 10    The bill also addresses administrative costs under the
  7 11 preschool program by increasing the allowable administrative
  7 12 costs for school districts from 5 to 10 percent.
  7 13    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 14 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 15 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 16 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 17 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 18 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 19 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 20 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 21 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 22 mandates included in the bill.

  6  2    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6  3 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6  4 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6  5 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6  8 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6  9 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 10 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other

  6 12 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 13 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 14 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 15    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 16 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 17 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 18 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 19 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 20 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 21 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 22 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 23 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 24 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 25    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  6 26 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, July 1, 2019, and July
  6 27 1, 2020.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  6 28 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  6 29 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  6 30 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  6 31 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.

  6 33 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  6 34 preschool programming on October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015,
  6 35 and October 1, 2016.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7  1 equal to 10 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7  2 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7  3 base year.
  7  4    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7  5 increases in costs in connection with the school district's

  7 15 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 16 district from state school foundation aid received by the

  7 18 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 19 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The

  5 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 27    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program for
  5 28 four=year=old children by establishing a preschool program
  5 29 expansion incentive and authorizing state aid for the
  5 30 incentive. The bill also addresses costs allowed under the
  5 31 program.
  5 32    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  5 33 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  5 34 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  5 35 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6  1 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.
  6  2    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6  3 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6  4 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6  5 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6  8 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6  9 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 10 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 11 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 12 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 13 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 14 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 15    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 16 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 17 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 18 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 19 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 20 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 21 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 22 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 23 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 24 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 25    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  6 26 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, July 1, 2019, and July
  6 27 1, 2020.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  6 28 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  6 29 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  6 30 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  6 31 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  6 32 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  6 33 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  6 34 preschool programming on October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015,
  6 35 and October 1, 2016.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7  1 equal to 10 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7  2 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7  3 base year.
  7  4    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7  5 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7  6 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7  7 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7  8 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7  9 the department.
  7 10    The bill also addresses administrative costs under the
  7 11 preschool program by increasing the allowable administrative
  7 12 costs for school districts from 5 to 10 percent.
  7 13    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 14 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 15 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 16 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 17 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification

  5 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 27    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program for
  5 28 four=year=old children by establishing a preschool program
  5 29 expansion incentive and authorizing state aid for the
  5 30 incentive. The bill also addresses costs allowed under the
  5 31 program.
  5 32    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  5 33 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  5 34 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  5 35 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6  1 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.
  6  2    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6  3 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6  4 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6  5 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6  8 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6  9 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 10 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 11 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 12 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 13 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 14 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 15    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 16 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 17 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 18 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 19 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 20 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 21 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 22 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 23 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 24 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 25    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  6 26 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, July 1, 2019, and July
  6 27 1, 2020.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  6 28 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  6 29 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  6 30 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  6 31 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  6 32 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  6 33 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  6 34 preschool programming on October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015,
  6 35 and October 1, 2016.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7  1 equal to 10 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7  2 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7  3 base year.
  7  4    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7  5 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7  6 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7  7 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7  8 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7  9 the department.
  7 10    The bill also addresses administrative costs under the
  7 11 preschool program by increasing the allowable administrative
  7 12 costs for school districts from 5 to 10 percent.
  7 13    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 14 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 15 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 16 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 17 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 18 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 19 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 20 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 21 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  5 32    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  5 33 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  5 34 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  5 35 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6  1 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.
  6  2    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6  3 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6  4 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6  5 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6  8 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6  9 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 10 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 11 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 12 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 13 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 14 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 15    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 16 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 17 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 18 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 19 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 20 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 21 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 22 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 23 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 24 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 25    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  6 26 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, July 1, 2019, and July
  6 27 1, 2020.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  6 28 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  6 29 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  6 30 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  6 31 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  6 32 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  6 33 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  6 34 preschool programming on October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015,
  6 35 and October 1, 2016.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7  1 equal to 10 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7  2 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7  3 base year.
  7  4    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7  5 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7  6 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7  7 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7  8 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7  9 the department.
  7 10    The bill also addresses administrative costs under the
  7 11 preschool program by increasing the allowable administrative
  7 12 costs for school districts from 5 to 10 percent.
  7 13    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 14 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 15 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 16 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 17 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 18 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 19 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 20 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the

  5 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 27    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program for
  5 28 four=year=old children by establishing a preschool program
  5 29 expansion incentive and authorizing state aid for the
  5 30 incentive. The bill also addresses costs allowed under the
  5 31 program.
  5 32    Code section 256C.3, relating to preschool program
  5 33 requirements, is amended to require each school district to
  5 34 implement a plan for the school district's preschool program to
  5 35 have sufficient capacity to operate without a waiting list for
  6  1 school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.
  6  2    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6  3 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6  4 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6  5 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6  8 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6  9 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 10 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other
  6 11 requirements for the plan and for approval of plans by the
  6 12 department. The bill requires the department of education to
  6 13 analyze the enhancements to the preschool program following the
  6 14 incentives period and submit a report to the general assembly.
  6 15    Current law in Code section 256C.4 prohibits inclusion
  6 16 in the preschool program of children already included in a
  6 17 school's enrollment count for purposes of the school aid
  6 18 foundation formula or children who are served by an existing
  6 19 preschool program already receiving state or federal funds for
  6 20 the purpose of providing four=year=old preschool programming
  6 21 while the child is being served by the existing program.  The
  6 22 bill allows inclusion of children participating in an existing
  6 23 program if the preschool programming in the existing program
  6 24 has been enhanced as part of the expansion incentive.
  6 25    The incentive program will operate for the three school
  6 26 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, July 1, 2019, and July
  6 27 1, 2020.  For those three budget years, a school district is
  6 28 eligible to receive incentive state aid for the increase in
  6 29 the actual enrollment of eligible students in the preschool
  6 30 programming provided by a school district in the immediately
  6 31 preceding school year over the base incentive enrollment.
  6 32 The base incentive enrollment is the average of the actual
  6 33 enrollments of eligible students in the school district's
  6 34 preschool programming on October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015,
  6 35 and October 1, 2016.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7  1 equal to 10 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7  2 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7  3 base year.
  7  4    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7  5 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7  6 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7  7 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7  8 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7  9 the department.
  7 10    The bill also addresses administrative costs under the
  7 11 preschool program by increasing the allowable administrative
  7 12 costs for school districts from 5 to 10 percent.
  7 13    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 14 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 15 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school

  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
  6  8 collaborate with participating families, early care providers,
  6  9 and community partners to expand the district's preschool
  6 10 enrollment.  The department of education is to specify other

  6 34 preschool programming on October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015,
  6 35 and October 1, 2016.  The amount of incentive state aid is
  7  1 equal to 10 percent of the regular program state cost per pupil
  7  2 multiplied by the school district's incentive enrollment in the
  7  3 base year.
  7  4    The incentive state aid is required to be used to defray
  7  5 increases in costs in connection with the school district's
  7  6 preschool expansion plan.  Such costs may include renovation
  7  7 and other facility costs connected with expansion, outreach,
  7  8 one=time expenses, and other costs identified as eligible by
  7  9 the department.
  7 10    The bill also addresses administrative costs under the

  6  2    To be eligible for the preschool expansion incentive,
  6  3 a school district must develop and implement a preschool
  6  4 expansion plan, approved by the department, in order to expand
  6  5 enrollment of eligible students in the school district's
  6  6 preschool programming.  Requirements for the plan are
  6  7 provided in the bill, including how the school district will
