  3 25 applicator must either pass an examination every third year or
  3 26 attend two hours of continuing instructional courses every year

  2 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 28    GENERAL.  This bill provides for an educational program
  2 29 administered by the department of agriculture and land
  2 30 stewardship (DALS) that currently requires a person who
  2 31 regularly applies pesticides to obtain an initial certification
  2 32 or a renewal of a certification through a process of passing an
  2 33 examination and attending instructional courses (referred to as
  2 34 an educational program).
  2 35    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ADMINISTRATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL
  3  1 PROGRAM.  The bill provides that the department may select
  3  2 a qualified person to administer the program by giving
  3  3 examinations as well as instructional courses.  It provides
  3  4 that Iowa state university of science and technology (ISU) may
  3  5 cooperate with the department to provide the same services.
  3  6    BILL'S PROVISIONS == USE OF THE INTERNET.  The bill provides
  3  7 that DALS must make the educational program available via the
  3  8 department's internet site.  It also provides that DALS must
  3  9 cooperate with the qualified selected person or ISU to also
  3 10 make the educational program available via their internet
  3 11 sites.  However, DALS is not required to commence or complete
  3 12 this project unless it is appropriated necessary moneys by the
  3 13 general assembly.
  3 14    BACKGROUND.  The provision amended by the bill (Code
  3 15 section 206.5) is part of the "Pesticide Act of Iowa" (Code
  3 16 section 206.1).  There are three classes of persons required
  3 17 to be certified in order to apply pesticides:  (1) a private
  3 18 applicator who applies a restricted use pesticide on their own
  3 19 farmland or on another's farmland in return for services, (2) a
  3 20 commercial applicator who applies pesticides on someone else's
  3 21 property, and (3) a public applicator who applies pesticides
  3 22 as part of employment by the state or local government (Code
  3 23 section 206.2).  In order to be initially certified, the
  3 24 applicator must pass an examination, and to be recertified, the
  3 25 applicator must either pass an examination every third year or
  3 26 attend two hours of continuing instructional courses every year
  3 27 (Code section 206.5). ISU's Iowa cooperative extension service
  3 28 in agriculture and home economics cooperates in administering
  3 29 the continuing instructional courses.

  2 28    GENERAL.  This bill provides for an educational program
  2 29 administered by the department of agriculture and land
  2 30 stewardship (DALS) that currently requires a person who
  2 31 regularly applies pesticides to obtain an initial certification
  2 32 or a renewal of a certification through a process of passing an
  2 33 examination and attending instructional courses (referred to as
  2 34 an educational program).
  2 35    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ADMINISTRATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL
  3  1 PROGRAM.  The bill provides that the department may select
  3  2 a qualified person to administer the program by giving
  3  3 examinations as well as instructional courses.  It provides
  3  4 that Iowa state university of science and technology (ISU) may
  3  5 cooperate with the department to provide the same services.
  3  6    BILL'S PROVISIONS == USE OF THE INTERNET.  The bill provides
  3  7 that DALS must make the educational program available via the
  3  8 department's internet site.  It also provides that DALS must
  3  9 cooperate with the qualified selected person or ISU to also
  3 10 make the educational program available via their internet
  3 11 sites.  However, DALS is not required to commence or complete
  3 12 this project unless it is appropriated necessary moneys by the
  3 13 general assembly.
  3 14    BACKGROUND.  The provision amended by the bill (Code
  3 15 section 206.5) is part of the "Pesticide Act of Iowa" (Code
  3 16 section 206.1).  There are three classes of persons required
  3 17 to be certified in order to apply pesticides:  (1) a private
  3 18 applicator who applies a restricted use pesticide on their own
  3 19 farmland or on another's farmland in return for services, (2) a
  3 20 commercial applicator who applies pesticides on someone else's
  3 21 property, and (3) a public applicator who applies pesticides
  3 22 as part of employment by the state or local government (Code
  3 23 section 206.2).  In order to be initially certified, the
  3 24 applicator must pass an examination, and to be recertified, the
  3 25 applicator must either pass an examination every third year or
  3 26 attend two hours of continuing instructional courses every year
  3 27 (Code section 206.5). ISU's Iowa cooperative extension service
  3 28 in agriculture and home economics cooperates in administering
  3 29 the continuing instructional courses.

  3  7 that DALS must make the educational program available via the
  3  8 department's internet site.  It also provides that DALS must
  3  9 cooperate with the qualified selected person or ISU to also
  3 10 make the educational program available via their internet
  3 11 sites.  However, DALS is not required to commence or complete
  3 12 this project unless it is appropriated necessary moneys by the
  3 13 general assembly.
  3 14    BACKGROUND.  The provision amended by the bill (Code
  3 15 section 206.5) is part of the "Pesticide Act of Iowa" (Code
  3 16 section 206.1).  There are three classes of persons required
  3 17 to be certified in order to apply pesticides:  (1) a private
  3 18 applicator who applies a restricted use pesticide on their own
  3 19 farmland or on another's farmland in return for services, (2) a
  3 20 commercial applicator who applies pesticides on someone else's
  3 21 property, and (3) a public applicator who applies pesticides
  3 22 as part of employment by the state or local government (Code
  3 23 section 206.2).  In order to be initially certified, the
  3 24 applicator must pass an examination, and to be recertified, the
  3 25 applicator must either pass an examination every third year or
  3 26 attend two hours of continuing instructional courses every year
  3 27 (Code section 206.5). ISU's Iowa cooperative extension service
