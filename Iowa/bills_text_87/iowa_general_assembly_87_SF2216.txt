  5 35 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  6  1 compliance with any state mandate included in this Act shall
  6  2 be paid by a school district from state school foundation aid
  6  3 received by the school district under section 257.16.  This
  6  4 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed
  6  5 to meet all of the state funding=related requirements of
  6  6 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding
  6  7 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act
  6  8 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school
  6  9 districts.
  6 10                           EXPLANATION
  6 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 13    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  6 14 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  6 15 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  6 16 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  6  4 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed

  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  6  5 to meet all of the state funding=related requirements of
  6  6 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding
  6  7 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act
  6  8 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school
  6  9 districts.
  6 10                           EXPLANATION
  6 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 13    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  6 14 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  6 15 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  6 16 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.

  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1

  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  6 16 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code

  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal

  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the

  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1

  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  6  6 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding
  6  7 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act
  6  8 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school
  6  9 districts.
  6 10                           EXPLANATION
  6 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 13    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  6 14 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  6 15 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  6 16 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose

  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.

  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a

  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the

  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  6 10                           EXPLANATION
  6 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 13    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  6 14 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  6 15 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  6 16 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without

  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to

  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the

  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  6 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 13    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  6 14 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  6 15 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  6 16 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be

  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must

  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  6 16 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  6 17 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.

  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a

  6 18 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  6 19 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  6 20 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  6 21 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue
  7 26 purpose statement, subject to approval of the electors.
  7 27    Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  7 28 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  7 29 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the

  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal

  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
  8 10 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the

  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the

  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the

  6 22 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  6 23 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  6 24 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  6 25 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  6 26 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  6 27 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  6 28 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  6 29 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  6 30    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  6 31 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  6 32 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  6 33    Current law requires that one=sixth of the revenue from the
  6 34 6 percent statewide sales tax be deposited in the SAVE fund
  6 35 for distribution to school districts on a per pupil basis.
  7  1 Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to such distribution,
  7  2 2.1 percent of the moneys available in the SAVE fund are
  7  3 distributed and credited to the property tax equity and relief
  7  4 (PTER) fund to be used for additional property tax levy aid.
  7  5 The bill provides that for each fiscal year beginning on or
  7  6 after July 1, 2018, the percentage used to determine the
  7  7 amount of the transfer from the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is
  7  8 equal to the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal
  7  9 year, unless the amount of money available in the SAVE fund
  7 10 in the fiscal year is equal to or exceeds 102 percent of the
  7 11 amount of money available in the SAVE fund for the immediately
  7 12 preceding fiscal year, in which case the percentage shall be
  7 13 the percentage for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus 1
  7 14 percent.  However, the bill caps the percentage at 10 percent.
  7 15    Code section 423F.3(1) generally describes the uses for
  7 16 which a school district may use revenues from the SAVE fund
  7 17 if the school district does not have a valid revenue purpose
  7 18 statement.  The bill excludes the construction or purchase of
  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,
  7 20 approved by the school board on or after July 1, 2018, from
  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if
  7 22 a school board intends to use SAVE funds for the construction
  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must

  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue

  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the

  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the

  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the

  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  7 32 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  8  5 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  8  6 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  8  7 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023.
  8  8    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
  8  9 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without

  8 11 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
  8 14 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
  8 15 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
  8 16 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9 12 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9 13 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9 17 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9 18 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9 19 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  9 20 mandates included in the bill.

  7 19 an extracurricular athletic facility, as defined in the bill,

  7 21 that list of authorized uses.  The bill also provides that if

  7 23 or purchase of an extracurricular athletic facility that is
  7 24 approved by the board on or after July 1, 2018, such use must
  7 25 first be specifically included in the school district's revenue

  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  7 34 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  7 35 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  8  2 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  8  3 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  8  4 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the

  8 12 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
  8 13 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following

  8 17 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
  8 18 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
  8 19 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  8 20 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
  8 21 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
  8 22 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
  8 23 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
  8 24 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
  8 25 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
  8 26 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
  8 27 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
  8 28 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
  8 29 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
  8 30    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
  8 31 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
  8 32 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
  8 33 to the department of education for a certificate of need
  8 34 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
  8 35 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
  9  1 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
  9  2 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
  9  3 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
  9  4 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
  9  5    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
  9  6 department of education in determining whether to issue a
  9  7 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
  9  8 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
  9  9 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
  9 10 new construction on student learning.
  9 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  9 14 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9 15 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
  9 16 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate

  8  1 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include

  7 30 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  7 31 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school

  7 33 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
