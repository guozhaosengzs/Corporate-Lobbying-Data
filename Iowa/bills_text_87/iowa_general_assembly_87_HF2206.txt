  4 11                           EXPLANATION
  4 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 14    This bill requires the board of directors of each public
  4 15 school district to have a short=term test for radon gas
  4 16 performed at each attendance center under its control at least
  4 17 once by June 30, 2022, and at least once every five years
  4 18 thereafter, and following new construction of an attendance
  4 19 center or additions, renovations, or repairs to an attendance
  4 20 center. If the results of such a test are at or above four
  4 21 picocuries per liter, the bill requires the board to have a
  4 22 second short=term test performed at the attendance center
  4 23 within 90 days.
  4 24    If the results of a second test are at or above four
  4 25 picocuries per liter, the bill requires the board of directors
  4 26 of the public school district to retain a person credentialed
  4 27 to perform radon abatement measures to develop a radon
  4 28 mitigation plan within 90 days. The radon mitigation plan must
  4 29 be implemented within one year.
  4 30    If the results of a short=term test at an attendance center
  4 31 at which a radon mitigation plan has been implemented are at or
  4 32 above four picocuries per liter, the bill requires the board
  4 33 of directors of the public school district to retain a person
  4 34 credentialed to perform radon abatement measures to develop
  4 35 an alternative radon mitigation plan within 90 days. The
  5  1 alternative radon mitigation plan must be implemented within
  5  2 one year.
  5  3    The bill requires biennial, short=term radon testing for any
  5  4 school site at which a radon mitigation plan or an alternative
  5  5 radon mitigation plan has been implemented, which continues
  5  6 until the results have been less than four picocuries per liter
  5  7 for four consecutive years.
  5  8    The bill defines "short=term test" as a test approved by
  5  9 the department of public health in which a testing device
  5 10 remains in an area for not less than two days and not more than
  5 11 90 days to determine the amount of radon in the air.  Radon
  5 12 testing pursuant to the bill conducted on and after July 1,
  5 13 2022, must be performed by a person certified to conduct such
  5 14 testing as prescribed by the department of public health.
  5 15 Radon mitigation plans and alternative radon mitigation plans
  5 16 pursuant to the bill must be developed and implemented as
  5 17 prescribed by the department of public health.
  5 18    The bill requires the board of directors of each public
  5 19 school district to submit the results of each radon test
  5 20 conducted at an attendance center pursuant to the bill to the
  5 21 department of education on the annual basic educational data
  5 22 survey (BEDS) report. The bill requires the department of
  5 23 education to publish the submitted results on the department's
  5 24 internet site for public review and to provide the submitted
  5 25 results to the department of public health. Each school
  5 26 district shall also publish its most recent results on its
  5 27 school district internet site.
  5 28    The bill requires the department of public health and
  5 29 the department of education to each adopt rules to jointly
  5 30 administer the provisions of the bill relating to radon testing
  5 31 in schools. The bill also requires the department of public
  5 32 health and the department of education to approve standards for
  5 33 the design and construction of school buildings to reduce radon
  5 34 entry and facilitate radon remediation.
  5 35    The bill adds radon testing and radon mitigation pursuant
  6  1 to the bill to the list of permissible uses of a physical
  6  2 plant and equipment levy by a school district. The bill adds
  6  3 radon testing conducted pursuant to the bill to the list of
  6  4 permissible uses of a physical plant and equipment levy or
  6  5 revenues from the secure an advanced vision for education fund
  6  6 under Code section 423F.3.
  6  7    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  6  8 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  6  9 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  6 10 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  6 11 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  6 12 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  6 13 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  6 14 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  6 15 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  6 16 mandates included in the bill.
  6 17    The bill makes inapplicable Code section 423F.3, subsection
  6 18 7, which requires a bill that would alter the purposes for
  6 19 which the revenues received under Code section 423F.3 may be
  6 20 used from infrastructure and property tax relief purposes
  6 21 to any other purpose to be approved by a vote of at least
  6 22 two=thirds of the members of both chambers of the general
  6 23 assembly.
