  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill modifies several provisions in Code chapter 34A
  6 30 that relate to 911 emergency telephone communication systems.
  6 31    The bill defines "911 call processing equipment" as
  6 32 equipment owned by the department of homeland security and
  6 33 emergency management (HSEMD) that functions in a host remote
  6 34 environment, provides 911 call processing functionality
  6 35 to public safety answering points, and utilizes the next
  7  1 generation 911 network, including but not limited to computer
  7  2 aided dispatch, voice logging recorders, mapping, and emergency
  7  3 medical dispatch. The bill defines "911 call processing
  7  4 equipment provider" as a vendor or vendors selected by HSEMD
  7  5 to provide call processing equipment. The bill defines "911
  7  6 call transport provider" as a vendor or vendors selected by
  7  7 HSEMD to deliver aggregated wire=line 911 call traffic to the
  7  8 next generation 911 network and from the next generation 911
  7  9 network to public safety answering points. The bill defines
  7 10 "next generation 911 network service provider" as a vendor
  7 11 or vendors selected by HSEMD to provide next generation 911
  7 12 network functionality.
  7 13    The bill removes the identification of the agency
  7 14 responsible for the 911 emergency communication system and
  7 15 equipment operated by local exchange service providers from
  7 16 the information required in the definition of "911 service
  7 17 plan". The bill also includes 911 call processing equipment
  7 18 and internet and telephone access in the statement of estimated
  7 19 costs required, as defined in "911 service plan". The bill
  7 20 amends the definition of "next generation 911 network" by
  7 21 specifying that it is responsible for the delivery of all 911
  7 22 messages within the state and that it includes 911 voice and
  7 23 nonvoice messages generated by originating service providers.
  7 24 The bill amends the definition of "voice over internet protocol
  7 25 service" by specifying that the service must provide real=time
  7 26 two=way voice communications transmitted using internet
  7 27 protocol or a successor protocol.
  7 28    The bill requires the wire=line service surcharge collected
  7 29 pursuant to Code section 34A.7 to be remitted to the joint 911
  7 30 service board instead of the 911 service operating authority.
  7 31    The bill modifies several provisions in Code section 34A.7A,
  7 32 which relates to the distribution and permissible expenditures
  7 33 of the 911 emergency communications service surcharge. The
  7 34 bill removes the requirement for public safety answering points
  7 35 to submit written requests to the program manager to receive
  8  1 specified funding. The bill removes the requirement for the
  8  2 program manager to reimburse originating service providers
  8  3 for expenses related to the delivery of wireless E911 phase
  8  4 1 services and the integration of the next generation 911
  8  5 network. The bill places the ability of the program manager to
  8  6 provide grants to joint 911 service boards and the department
  8  7 of public safety for developing and maintaining GIS data in
  8  8 a lower priority on the order of permissible expenditures.
  8  9 The bill requires the program manager to reimburse next
  8 10 generation 911 network service providers, 911 call processing
  8 11 equipment providers, 911 call transport providers, and

  8 14 911 network functionality, 911 call processing equipment, 911
  8 15 call transport, and the automatic location identification
  8 16 database. The bill removes the allocation of up to $7 million
  8 17 for distribution to the obligations listed in Code section
  8 18 34A.7A(2)(g) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and
  8 19 provides that remaining funds shall be distributed to such
  8 20 obligations.
  8 21    The bill requires local exchange service providers to
  8 22 furnish certain information specified in Code section 34A.8 to
  8 23 the next generation 911 network service provider designated by
  8 24 HSEMD instead of the 911 service provider designated by the
  8 25 joint 911 service board.
  8 26    The bill requires HSEMD to implement its plan to consolidate
  8 27 the wire=line 911 network with the next generation 911 network.
  8 28 Joint 911 service boards shall continue to pay the costs of
  8 29 providing wire=line 911 service during the consolidation.
  8 30 When HSEMD notifies a joint 911 service board that wire=line
  8 31 911 service is being delivered to public safety answering
  8 32 points within its 911 service area via the next generation

  6 35 to public safety answering points, and utilizes the next
  7  1 generation 911 network, including but not limited to computer
  7  2 aided dispatch, voice logging recorders, mapping, and emergency
  7  3 medical dispatch. The bill defines "911 call processing
  7  4 equipment provider" as a vendor or vendors selected by HSEMD

  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill modifies several provisions in Code chapter 34A
  6 30 that relate to 911 emergency telephone communication systems.
  6 31    The bill defines "911 call processing equipment" as
  6 32 equipment owned by the department of homeland security and
  6 33 emergency management (HSEMD) that functions in a host remote
  6 34 environment, provides 911 call processing functionality
  6 35 to public safety answering points, and utilizes the next
  7  1 generation 911 network, including but not limited to computer
  7  2 aided dispatch, voice logging recorders, mapping, and emergency
  7  3 medical dispatch. The bill defines "911 call processing
  7  4 equipment provider" as a vendor or vendors selected by HSEMD
  7  5 to provide call processing equipment. The bill defines "911
  7  6 call transport provider" as a vendor or vendors selected by
  7  7 HSEMD to deliver aggregated wire=line 911 call traffic to the
  7  8 next generation 911 network and from the next generation 911
  7  9 network to public safety answering points. The bill defines
  7 10 "next generation 911 network service provider" as a vendor
  7 11 or vendors selected by HSEMD to provide next generation 911
  7 12 network functionality.
  7 13    The bill removes the identification of the agency
  7 14 responsible for the 911 emergency communication system and
  7 15 equipment operated by local exchange service providers from

  7 18 and internet and telephone access in the statement of estimated
  7 19 costs required, as defined in "911 service plan". The bill
  7 20 amends the definition of "next generation 911 network" by
  7 21 specifying that it is responsible for the delivery of all 911
  7 22 messages within the state and that it includes 911 voice and

  7 28    The bill requires the wire=line service surcharge collected
  7 29 pursuant to Code section 34A.7 to be remitted to the joint 911
  7 30 service board instead of the 911 service operating authority.
  7 31    The bill modifies several provisions in Code section 34A.7A,

  8  6 provide grants to joint 911 service boards and the department
  8  7 of public safety for developing and maintaining GIS data in
  8  8 a lower priority on the order of permissible expenditures.
  8  9 The bill requires the program manager to reimburse next
  8 10 generation 911 network service providers, 911 call processing
  8 11 equipment providers, 911 call transport providers, and

  8 20 obligations.
  8 21    The bill requires local exchange service providers to
  8 22 furnish certain information specified in Code section 34A.8 to
  8 23 the next generation 911 network service provider designated by
  8 24 HSEMD instead of the 911 service provider designated by the
  8 25 joint 911 service board.
  8 26    The bill requires HSEMD to implement its plan to consolidate
  8 27 the wire=line 911 network with the next generation 911 network.
  8 28 Joint 911 service boards shall continue to pay the costs of
