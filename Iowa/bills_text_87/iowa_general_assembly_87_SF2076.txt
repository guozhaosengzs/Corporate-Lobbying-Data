  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or

  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is

  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must

  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or

  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall

  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall

  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or

  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall

  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall

  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or

  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a

  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language

  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or
  9  6 experience each individual member must bring to the committee.
  9  7    The director of the department must convene the advisory

  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language
  8 24 developmental milestones from existing standardized norms,
  8 25 along with any relevant information held by the department
  8 26 regarding those milestones.
  8 27    The advisory committee may make recommendations on the
  8 28 selection and use of the educator tools or assessments, may
  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language
  8 24 developmental milestones from existing standardized norms,

  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or

  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall

  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a

  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department

  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall

  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family

  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department

  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department

  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department

  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of

  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area

  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language

  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language

  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language
  8 24 developmental milestones from existing standardized norms,
  8 25 along with any relevant information held by the department
  8 26 regarding those milestones.
  8 27    The advisory committee may make recommendations on the
  8 28 selection and use of the educator tools or assessments, may
  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or
  9  6 experience each individual member must bring to the committee.
  9  7    The director of the department must convene the advisory
  9  8 committee by March 1, 2019, and thereafter may convene the

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.

  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five

  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language

  8 28 selection and use of the educator tools or assessments, may
  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or

  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department

  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language
  8 24 developmental milestones from existing standardized norms,
  8 25 along with any relevant information held by the department
  8 26 regarding those milestones.
  8 27    The advisory committee may make recommendations on the
  8 28 selection and use of the educator tools or assessments, may
  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or
  9  6 experience each individual member must bring to the committee.
  9  7    The director of the department must convene the advisory
  9  8 committee by March 1, 2019, and thereafter may convene the
  9  9 committee as the director deems necessary. The advisory
  9 10 committee shall submit recommendations to the state board of

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language
  8 24 developmental milestones from existing standardized norms,
  8 25 along with any relevant information held by the department
  8 26 regarding those milestones.
  8 27    The advisory committee may make recommendations on the
  8 28 selection and use of the educator tools or assessments, may
  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or
  9  6 experience each individual member must bring to the committee.
  9  7    The director of the department must convene the advisory
  9  8 committee by March 1, 2019, and thereafter may convene the
  9  9 committee as the director deems necessary. The advisory
  9 10 committee shall submit recommendations to the state board of

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language
  8 24 developmental milestones from existing standardized norms,
  8 25 along with any relevant information held by the department
  8 26 regarding those milestones.
  8 27    The advisory committee may make recommendations on the
  8 28 selection and use of the educator tools or assessments, may
  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or
  9  6 experience each individual member must bring to the committee.
  9  7    The director of the department must convene the advisory
  9  8 committee by March 1, 2019, and thereafter may convene the
  9  9 committee as the director deems necessary. The advisory
  9 10 committee shall submit recommendations to the state board of

  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or
  7  6 hard=of=hearing.  The bill provides that "English" includes
  7  7 spoken English, written English, or English with the use of
  7  8 visual supplements.
  7  9    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ==== SELECTION.  The
  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf
  8  1 and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five years of age.
  8  2    DISSEMINATION.  The department of education must disseminate
  8  3 the parent resource to parents and guardians of deaf and
  8  4 hard=of=hearing children and, consistent with the federal IDEA,
  8  5 shall disseminate the educator tools and assessments to area
  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
  8 20    ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  The department of education is directed
  8 21 to establish and consult with an advisory committee to receive
  8 22 input for inclusion in the parent resource.  The department
  8 23 must provide the committee with a list of existing language
  8 24 developmental milestones from existing standardized norms,
  8 25 along with any relevant information held by the department
  8 26 regarding those milestones.
  8 27    The advisory committee may make recommendations on the
  8 28 selection and use of the educator tools or assessments, may
  8 29 advise the department or its consultants on the content and
  8 30 administration of the existing instrument used under the
  8 31 federal IDEA to assess deaf and hard=of=hearing children's
  8 32 language and literacy development to ensure the appropriate
  8 33 use of that instrument with such children, and may make
  8 34 recommendations regarding future research to improve the
  8 35 measurement of progress of deaf and hard=of=hearing children in
  9  1 language and literacy development.
  9  2    The advisory committee shall consist of 13 volunteers, the
  9  3 majority of whom shall be deaf or hard=of=hearing, and all of
  9  4 whom shall be within the field of education for the deaf and
  9  5 hard=of=hearing.  The bill specifies the level of expertise or
  9  6 experience each individual member must bring to the committee.

  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to

  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or

  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill provides for the development and dissemination of
  6 27 a parent resource for the parents and guardians of children who
  6 28 are deaf or hard=of=hearing; provides for the identification of
  6 29 tools or assessments educators can use to assess the language
  6 30 and literacy development of such children from birth to five
  6 31 years of age; requires, if such a child is not meeting language
  6 32 development milestones, that the child's individualized family
  6 33 service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP)
  6 34 team explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting
  6 35 the  milestones and submit modifications to the plan to assist
  7  1 the child in achieving English literacy proficiency; and
  7  2 provides for the establishment of an advisory committee for
  7  3 purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection
  7  4 of language developmental milestones for such children that
  7  5 are equivalent to milestones for children who are not deaf or

  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use

  8  6 education agencies, school districts, and accredited nonpublic
  8  7 schools for use in the development and modification of IFSPs
  8  8 or IEPs, and provide materials and training on the use of such
  8  9 materials.
  8 10    PLAN MODIFICATION.  If a deaf or hard=of=hearing child
  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.

  7 10 bill requires the director of the department of education
  7 11 to cooperate with the department of public health and the
  7 12 state school for the deaf in selecting language developmental
  7 13 milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of
  7 14 developing a resource parents or guardians can use to monitor
  7 15 and track a deaf or hard=of=hearing child's progress toward
  7 16 English literacy.
  7 17    PARENT RESOURCE.  In addition to the milestones, the parent
  7 18 resource must be clearly written and appropriate for use
  7 19 with deaf and hard=of=hearing children from birth to five
  7 20 years of age who use American sign language or English, or
  7 21 both; present the milestones in terms of typical development
  7 22 of all children; be aligned to the state's existing infant,
  7 23 toddler, and preschool guidelines and standards in English
  7 24 language arts, and with federal law, regarding the assessment
  7 25 instrument.  Under the bill, the term "federal law" means the
  7 26 federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as
  7 27 amended.  Further, the resource must clearly specify that it is
  7 28 not a formal assessment of language and literacy development,
  7 29 that the observations of a child by the child's parent or
  7 30 guardian may differ from formal assessment data, and that a
  7 31 parent or guardian may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or
  7 32 IEP meeting.
  7 33    ASSESSMENTS ==== TOOLS.  The department of education must
  7 34 select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be
  7 35 used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf

  8 11 does not demonstrate progress in improving expressive and
  8 12 receptive language skills, as measured by an educator tool or
  8 13 assessment, the child's IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, shall,
  8 14 as part of the process required by the federal IDEA, explain in
  8 15 detail the reasons why the child is not meeting or progressing
  8 16 toward meeting the language development milestones, and shall
  8 17 recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that must
  8 18 be provided under a modified IFSP or IEP, as appropriate, to
  8 19 assist the child in achieving English literacy proficiency.
