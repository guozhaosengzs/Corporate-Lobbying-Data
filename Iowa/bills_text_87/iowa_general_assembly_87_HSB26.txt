Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


finds
and
declares
the
following:
2


1.
Health
carriers,
health
benefit
plans,
and
utilization
3


review
organizations
are
increasingly
making
use
of
step
4


therapy
protocols
under
which
covered
persons
are
required
to
5


try
one
or
more
prescription
drugs
before
coverage
is
provided
6


for
another
prescription
drug
selected
by
the
covered
person’s
7


health
care
professional.
8


2.
Such
step
therapy
protocols,
where
they
are
based
on
9


well-developed
scientific
standards
and
administered
in
a
10


flexible
manner
that
takes
into
account
the
individual
needs
11


of
covered
persons,
can
play
an
important
part
in
controlling
12


health
care
costs.
13


3.
In
some
cases,
requiring
a
covered
person
to
follow
14


a
step
therapy
protocol
may
have
adverse
and
even
dangerous
15


consequences
for
the
covered
person,
who
may
either
not
realize
16


a
benefit
from
taking
a
particular
prescription
drug
or
may
17


suffer
harm
from
taking
an
inappropriate
prescription
drug.
18


4.
Without
uniform
policies
in
the
state
for
step
therapy
19


protocols,
all
covered
persons
may
not
receive
equivalent
or
20


the
most
appropriate
treatment.
21


5.
It
is
imperative
that
step
therapy
protocols
in
the
state
22


preserve
the
health
care
professional’s
right
to
make
treatment
23


decisions
that
are
in
the
best
interest
of
the
covered
person.
24


6.
It
is
a
matter
of
public
interest
that
the
general
25


assembly
require
health
carriers,
health
benefit
plans,
and
26


utilization
review
organizations
to
base
step
therapy
protocols
27


on
appropriate
clinical
practice
guidelines
or
published
peer
28


review
data
developed
by
independent
experts
with
knowledge
29


of
the
condition
or
conditions
under
consideration;
that


30


covered
persons
be
excepted
from
step
therapy
protocols
when
31


inappropriate
or
otherwise
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
32


covered
persons;
and
that
covered
persons
have
access
to
a
33


fair,
transparent,
and
independent
process
for
allowing
a
34


covered
person
or
a
health
care
professional
to
request

used
by
health
carriers,
19


health

that

flexibly
22


administered
can
play
an
