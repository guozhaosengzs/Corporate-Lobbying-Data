  3 14    This bill provides for a high=demand occupation tax credit
  3 15 to facilitate an increase in the number of Iowans prepared to
  3 16 enter high=demand occupational fields.
  3 17    To qualify, the taxpayer must enroll in and attend a course
  3 18 of study at a community college which results in the community
  3 19 college conferring a credential that qualifies the taxpayer
  3 20 for a high=demand occupation.  The bill defines "high=demand
  3 21 occupation" as an occupation in the fields of science,
  3 22 technology, engineering, and mathematics, and occupations

  3 24 areas.
  3 25    The taxpayer must also execute an agreement with the
  3 26 community college for at least two years, but not more than
  3 27 five years, under which the taxpayer maintains a grade point
  3 28 average of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 grade scale.
  3 29    If the taxpayer meets the terms of the agreement, the
  3 30 community college submits to the department of revenue the
  3 31 total amount of tuition and mandatory fees paid by the taxpayer
  3 32 in earning a credential, and the department must issue the

  3 34 amount paid by the taxpayer to the community college for
  3 35 tuition and mandatory fees.
