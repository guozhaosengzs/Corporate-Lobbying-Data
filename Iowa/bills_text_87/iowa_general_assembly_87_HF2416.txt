  3  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  6    In 2017, the general assembly amended Code section 321.477
  3  7 to specify the powers, duties, and limitations of department of
  3  8 transportation (DOT) employees designated as peace officers.
  3  9 Under Code section 321.477, the DOT is authorized to designate
  3 10 by resolution certain of its employees upon each of whom there
  3 11 is conferred the authority of a peace officer to enforce all
  3 12 laws of the state including but not limited to the rules and
  3 13 regulations of the DOT. Employees designated as peace officers
  3 14 in this manner have the same powers conferred by law on
  3 15 peace officers for the enforcement of all laws of this state
  3 16 and the apprehension of violators. Under the terms of the
  3 17 2017 legislation, the amended language is set to be repealed
  3 18 effective July 1, 2018. Because this bill amends language
  3 19 enacted in 2017, the bill repeals the future repeal provision.
  3 20    The bill alters Code section 321.477 to provide that DOT
  3 21 employees designated as peace officers shall only engage in
  3 22 the enforcement of federal motor carrier safety regulations
  3 23 and federal motor carrier hazardous materials regulations;
  3 24 the regulation of the operating authority of motor carriers;
  3 25 the regulation of the movement, safety, and lawful operation
  3 26 of commercial motor vehicles; the regulation of the operating
  3 27 authority of commercial motor vehicle operators and the
  3 28 enforcement of traffic and safety laws on operators of
  3 29 commercial motor vehicles; the enforcement and performance
  3 30 of other activities necessary for the motor carrier safety
  3 31 assistance program and the high priority program; the
  3 32 investigation and enforcement of matters relating to or
  3 33 arising out of responsibilities entrusted to the DOT; the
  3 34 control and direction of traffic; the enforcement of motor
  3 35 vehicle laws relating to the operating authority, registration,
  4  1 size, weight, and load of motor vehicles and trailers; the

  4  4 of speed restrictions where a motor vehicle is traveling 15
  4  5 miles per hour or more over the legal speed limit; and the
