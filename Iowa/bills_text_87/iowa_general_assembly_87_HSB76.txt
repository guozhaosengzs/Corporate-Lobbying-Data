This

modifies
several
provisions
relating

public
18


utility
regulation
and
the
confidentiality
of
information
held
19


by
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
emergency
management
20


and
the
Iowa
utilities
board.
21


Code
section
22.7
lists
public
records
that
must
be
kept
22


confidential
from
public
disclosure,
including
critical
asset
23


protection
plan
information
held
by
the
department.
However,
24


Code
section
22.7(45)
allows
the
public
to
examine
a
list
of
25


assets
made
available
by
the
director
of
the
department.
The
26


bill
deletes
this
provision.
27


The
bill
further
amends
Code
section
22.7
by
making
28


infrastructure
information
and
records
relating
to
the
29


safeguarding
of
critical
infrastructure
systems
such
as
30


telecommunications,
electric,
water,
sanitary
sewage,
storm
31


water
drainage,
energy,
hazardous
liquid,
and
natural
gas,
held
32


by
the
department
and
the
utilities
board
confidential
from
33


public
disclosure.
This
includes
“cyber
security
information”,
34


defined
in
the
bill
as
including
but
not
limited
to

2


Code
section
476.6(9)
authorizes
utilities
to
collect
higher
3


rates
on
a
temporary
basis
while
the
utilities
board
conducts
4


a
rate
review
proceeding.
To
do
so,
utilities
have
the
5


option
of
either
first
obtaining
board
review
before
temporary
6


rates
are
placed
into
effect,
or
implementing
temporary
rates
7


without
board
review
within
10
days
after
filing
for
temporary
8


rates,
subject
to
the
board’s
authority
to
require
refunds
for
9


overpayment
if
the
board
later
determines
that
the
temporary
10


rates
were
not
based
on
previously
established
regulatory
11


principles.
The
bill
removes
the
option
for
utilities
to
first
12


request
board
review
before
implementing
temporary
rates.
13


Therefore,
utilities
seeking
temporary
rate
changes
may
do
14


so
only
by
implementing
the
rates,
without
the
board’s
prior
15


approval,
on
or
after
10
days
following
the
filing
date
with
16


the
board.
If
the
board
fails
to
make
a
final
decision
on
17


a
temporary
rate
change
within
10
months
after
filing,
the
18


temporary
rates
are
deemed
approved
by
the
board
and
may
be
19


placed
into
effect
on
a
permanent
basis.
20


Code
chapter
478
requires
any
person
wanting
to
operate
21


and
maintain
electric
transmission
lines
to
file
a
petition
22


for
a
franchise
from
the
utilities
board.
Under
the
process
23


described
in
Code
section
478.2,
a
person
must
first
hold
a
24


public
information
meeting
in
each
county
where
real
property
25


or
rights
will
be
affected,
at
least
30
days
prior
to
filing
a
26


petition.
Code
section
478.2(2)(a)
requires
either
a
member
of
27


the
board,
the
counsel
of
the
board,
or
a
“hearing
examiner”
28


designated
by
the
board
to
serve
as
the
presiding
officer
for
29


a
public
information
meeting.
The
bill
replaces
the
term
30


“hearing
examiner”
with
“presiding
officer”.
Therefore,
either
31


a
member
of
the
board,
the
counsel
of
the
board,
or
a
presiding
32


officer
designated
by
the
board
can
serve
as
the
presiding
33


officer
at
a
public
information
meeting.
