32


from

or
other
biogas
produced
33


in

energy
for
use
for
a
commercial
purpose
in
Iowa
or
for
use
1


by
an
institution
in
Iowa.
The
bill
adds
that
“heat
for
a
2


commercial
purpose”
also
includes
heat
captured
during
the
3


generation
of
electricity
using
methane
gas
or
other
biogas
4


produced
by
a
biogas
recovery
facility
when
such
heat
is
used
5


for
a
commercial
purpose
for
which
fuel
or
electricity
would
6


otherwise
be
consumed.
7


Currently,
the
Code
chapter
specifies
the
dollar
value
8


of
renewable
energy
tax
credits
which
may
be
claimed
per
9


kilowatt-hour
of
electricity,
or
per
million
British
thermal
10


units
of
heat
for
a
commercial
purpose,
or
per
million
British
11


thermal
units
of
methane
gas
or
other
biogas
used
to
generate
12


electricity,
or
per
one
thousand
standard
cubic
feet
of
13


hydrogen
fuel.
The
bill
provides
that
a
producer
or
purchaser
14


of
renewable
energy
is
not
limited
to
claiming
one
form
of
15


these
four
differentiated
credits
but
may
instead
receive
more
16


than
one
credit
corresponding
to
each
type
of
heat
generated
or
17


captured
by
a
renewable
energy
facility.
18


Additionally,
current
Code
section
476.3(4)
specifies
the
19


maximum
amounts
of
energy
production
capacity
equivalent
of
20


renewable
energy
production
facilities
that
the
Iowa
utilities
21


board
may
find
eligible
for
a
renewable
energy
tax
credit.
22


The
bill
decreases
the
maximum
amount
of
nameplate
generating
23


capacity
(NGC)
with
respect
to
wind
energy
conversion
24


facilities
from
363
megawatts
to
343
megawatts.
The
bill
25


increases
the
maximum
amount
of
NGC
with
respect
to
all
26


other
facilities
from
63
megawatts
to
83
megawatts.
The
bill
27


provides
that
22.5
megawatts
out
of
the
total
83
megawatts
28


of
NGC
for
which
credits
may
be
issued
to
facilities
other
29


than
wind
energy
conversion
facilities
is
reserved
for
biogas
30


recovery
facilities
with
an
NGC
of
2.5
megawatts
or
less.
31


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
32


retroactively
to
January
1,
2014,
for
tax
years
beginning
on
33


or
