  4  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  4  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  4  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  4  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  4  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in

  4 33 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  4 34 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill relates to student data collection by the
  3 13 department of education, school districts, and accredited
  3 14 nonpublic schools. The bill requires the department to create

  3 29    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  3 30 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  3 31 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  3 32 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the

  4  1 form.
  4  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  4  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  4  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  4  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  4  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  4  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  4  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in

  4 10 280.25, 280.29, and 299A.11.
  4 11    The department must establish and maintain a policy relating
  4 12 to the sharing, security, and confidentiality of student data
  4 13 in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights

  4 28 in state and federal reporting requirements shall not be
  4 29 implemented.
