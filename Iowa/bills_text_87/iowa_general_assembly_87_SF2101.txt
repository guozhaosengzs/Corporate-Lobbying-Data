  1  7 of the following:
  1  8    (A)  A vertical line on a tree of at least eight inches in
  1  9 length and the bottom of the mark must be no less than three

  2 13 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 14 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 23 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 24 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on

  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 23 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 24 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with

  2 10 "a", subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (c).  The
  2 11 information provided shall inform the public about the
  2 12 marking requirements, including information regarding the
  2 13 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 14 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 23 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 24 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  2  5    Sec. 2.  DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING MARKING
  2  6 PROCEDURES.  The departments of agriculture and land
  2  7 stewardship and natural resources shall conduct an information
  2  8 campaign for the public concerning the implementation and
  2  9 interpretation of section 716.7, subsection 2, paragraph
  2 10 "a", subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (c).  The
  2 11 information provided shall inform the public about the
  2 12 marking requirements, including information regarding the
  2 13 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 14 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 23 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 24 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  2 14 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 23 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 24 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  1 23 possession shall concur in the decision to apply a cap or mark
  1 24 to the fence.
  1 25    (ii)  (A)  This subparagraph division (c) shall not be
  1 26 construed to authorize an owner, lessee, or other person in
  1 27 lawful possession of any property to place any purple marks or
  1 28 caps on any tree or post or to install any post or fence if
  1 29 doing so would violate any applicable law, rule, ordinance,

  2  3 described in this subparagraph division (c) is not valid or

  2  5    Sec. 2.  DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING MARKING
  2  6 PROCEDURES.  The departments of agriculture and land
  2  7 stewardship and natural resources shall conduct an information

  2 14 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 23 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 24 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is

  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees

  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch

  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than

  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following

  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The

  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by

  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the

  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,

  2 26 of the information.

  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship

  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to

  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,

  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and

  2  6 PROCEDURES.  The departments of agriculture and land

  2  8 campaign for the public concerning the implementation and
  2  9 interpretation of section 716.7, subsection 2, paragraph
  2 10 "a", subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (c).  The
  2 11 information provided shall inform the public about the
  2 12 marking requirements, including information regarding the
  2 13 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 14 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 15 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 16 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 17 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 18 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 23 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 24 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 25 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 26 of the information.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or

  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written

  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person

  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential

  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.

  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.

  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the

  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 12 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 13 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 14 the information.
  4 15    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 16 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 17 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 18 provisions of the bill.

  2 19 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 20 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 21 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 22 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship

  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the

  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 31 trespassing.
  2 32    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 33 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 34 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  2 35 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  1 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  2 notice.
  3  3    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  4 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  5 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  6 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  7 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  8 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3  9 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 10 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 11 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 12 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 13     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 14 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 15 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 16 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 17    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 18 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 19 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 20 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 21 not be used in a city.
  3 22    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 23 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 24 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 25 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 26 approaching the property.
  3 27    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 28 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 29 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 30 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 31 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 32 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 33 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 34 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  3 35 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  1 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  2 other person.
  4  3    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  4 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  5 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  6 trespassers on notice.
  4  7    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  8 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4  9 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 10 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 11 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
