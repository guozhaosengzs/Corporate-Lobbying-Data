  2 11    This bill modifies the contract bidding process conducted

  2 13    Currently, when the estimated cost of construction, repairs,
  2 14 or improvement of buildings or grounds under charge of the
  2 15 state board of regents exceeds $100,000, the board of regents
  2 16 must advertise for bids for the contemplated work and shall
  2 17 let the work to the lowest responsible bidder. However, if
  2 18 in the judgment of the state board of regents bids received
  2 19 are not acceptable, the state board of regents may reject all
  2 20 bids and proceed with the work by a method as the state board
  2 21 of regents may determine. All plans and specifications for
  2 22 repairs or construction, together with bids on the plans or
  2 23 specifications, must be filed by the state board of regents
  2 24 and be open for public inspection. All bids submitted under
  2 25 this Code section must be accompanied by a deposit of money, a
  2 26 certified check, or a credit union certified share draft in an
  2 27 amount as the state board of regents may prescribe.
  2 28    Under the bill, when the estimated cost of the work exceeds
  2 29 $100,000, the state board of regents must advertise for bids
  2 30 by publishing notice at least once, not less than four and
  2 31 not more than 45 days before the date for filing bids, in a
  2 32 newspaper published at least weekly with a general circulation
  2 33 in the geographical area of the work. The state board of
  2 34 regents may also publish notice in a relevant contractor
  2 35 organization publication or relevant contractor plan room
  3  1 service with statewide circulation, provided that a notice is
  3  2 posted on an internet site sponsored by the state board of
  3  3 regents.
  3  4    The state board of regents must also have a licensed or
  3  5 registered engineer, landscape architect, or architect prepare
  3  6 plans and specifications and calculate the estimated total
  3  7 cost of the contemplated improvement or construction. The
  3  8 state board of regents must ensure that a sufficient number of
  3  9 printed copies of the project's contract documents are made
  3 10 available for distribution at no charge to prospective bidders,
