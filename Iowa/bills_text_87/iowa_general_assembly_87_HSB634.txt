to
read
as
follows:
1


2.
A
person
who
persuades,
arranges,
coerces,
or
otherwise
2


causes
a
minor


person
under
the
age
of

to
become

or

EXPLANATION
10


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
12


This
bill
relates
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
the
13


juvenile
court
over
acts
of
prostitution
committed
by
14


individuals
under
the
age
of
18.
15


Currently,
if
a
person
under
the
age
of
18
is
found
to
have
16


engaged
in
prostitution,
the
law
allows
the
juvenile
court
17


to
waive
jurisdiction.
The
bill
requires,
notwithstanding
18


Code
section
232.8,
that
the
juvenile
court
retain
exclusive
19


jurisdiction
over
a
juvenile
alleged
to
have
committed
such
a
20


public
offense.
21


The
law
currently
provides
a
process
by
which
a
person
22


convicted
of
prostitution
when
the
person
was
under
the
age
of
23


18
can
have
the
conviction
expunged.
The
bill
retains
that
24


process
for
a
person
who
is
under
the
age
of
18
and
convicted
25


of
prostitution
on
or
before
June
30,
2018.
The
bill
provides
26


that
a
person
under
the
age
of
18
shall
not
be
charged
with,
or
27


convicted
of,
prostitution
under
a
local
ordinance.
28


Code
section
725.3
is
amended
to
replace
“minor”
with
29


“person
under
the
age
of
eighteen”
for
consistency.
