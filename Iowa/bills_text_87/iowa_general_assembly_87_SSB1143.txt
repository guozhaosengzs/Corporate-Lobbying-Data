11


SEXUAL
ABUSE
CIVIL
PROTECTIVE
ORDERS.
Under
current
law,
a
12


defendant
accused
of
sexual
abuse
must
be
arrested
for
sexual
13


abuse
before
a
victim
can
apply
for
a
criminal
no-contact
order
14


against
the
defendant
(Code
section
664A.3)
or
the
victim
can
15


apply
for
a
criminal
no-contact
order
against
a
defendant
upon
16


the
defendant’s
release
from
jail
or
prison
(Code
section
17


709.19).
18


This
division
creates
new
Code
chapter
236A,
the
sexual
19


abuse
Act,
allowing
a
victim
of
sexual
abuse
to
seek
relief
20


from
sexual
abuse
by
filing
a
petition
in
district
court
for
21


a
sexual
abuse
civil
protective
order
(emergency,
temporary,
22


or
permanent)
prior
to
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
in
such
a
23


situation
affording
the
victim
and
the
victim’s
family
members,
24


whose
welfare
may
be
affected
by
the
sexual
abuse
situation,
25


the
same
civil
protections
as
victims
of
domestic
abuse
under
26


Code
chapter
236.
The
division
defines
sexual
abuse
as
the
27


commission
of
a
crime
defined
in
Code
chapter
709
(sexual
28


abuse)
and
Code
sections
726.2
(incest)
and
728.12
(sexual
29


exploitation
of
a
minor),
and
includes
sexual
abuse
crimes
30


in
other
jurisdictions
under
statutes
that
are
substantially
31


similar
to
the
aforementioned
statutes.


32


Under
the
division,
upon
a
finding
by
the
court,
by
a
33


preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
a
defendant
has
engaged
in
34


sexual
abuse
against
the
plaintiff,
the
court
may
order
the

defendant
to

abuse,
and
order
the
defendant
1


to
stay
away
from
the
plaintiff’s
residence,
school,
or
place
2


of
employment.
In
seeking
a
protective
order,
a
victim
has
3


the
right
to
seek
help
from
the
court
with
or
without
the
4


assistance
of
an
attorney
and
without
the
payment
of
court
5


costs.
6


The
division
requires
criminal
and
juvenile
justice
agencies
7


to
collect
and
maintain
information
on
incidents
involving
8


sexual
abuse
and
to
provide
the
information
to
the
department
9


of
public
safety.
10


The
division
makes
conforming
changes
to
Code
provisions
11


relating
to
the
issuance
of
and
violations
of
civil
protective
12


orders,

order
victim

17


system
within
the
crime
victim
assistance
division
of
the
18


department
of
justice
to
assist
public

abuse
pursuant
20


to
Code
chapters
236
and
236A,
the
families
of
