  1  1    Section 1.  INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES FOR
  1  2 2016.  Notwithstanding the definition of "Internal Revenue
  1  3 Code" in section 15.335, subsection 7, section 422.3,
  1  4 subsection 5, section 422.10, subsection 3, section 422.32,
  1  5 subsection 1, and section 422.33, subsection 5, Code 2017,
  1  6 the following shall apply for the period beginning January 1,
  1  7 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax years beginning
  1  8 during the 2016 calendar year:
  1  9    1.  The definition of "Internal Revenue Code" for purposes
  1 10 of section 15.335, subsection 7, section 422.10, subsection 3,
  1 11 and section 422.33, subsection 5, Code 2017, and for purposes
  1 12 of references in the 2017 Iowa Code and 2017 Iowa Acts to the
  1 13 definition of "Internal Revenue Code" in those sections, shall
  1 14 mean the Internal Revenue Code in effect on January 1, 2017.
  1 15    2.  The definition of "Internal Revenue Code" for purposes
  1 16 of sections 422.3 and 422.32, Code 2017, and for purposes of
  1 17 references in the 2017 Iowa Code and 2017 Iowa Acts to the
  1 18 definition of "Internal Revenue Code" in those sections, shall
  1 19 mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, prior to the date of
  1 20 its redesignation as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by the
  1 21 Tax Reform Act of 1986, or means the Internal Revenue Code of
  1 22 1986 as amended to and including January 1, 2017.
  1 23    Sec. 2.  DEDUCTION FOR STATE SALES AND USE TAX FOR
  1 24 2016.  Notwithstanding section 422.9, subsection 2, paragraph
  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 35    Sec. 5.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies
  3  1 retroactively to January 1, 2016.
  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to

  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.

  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,

  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),

  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",

  1 10 of section 15.335, subsection 7, section 422.10, subsection 3,
  1 11 and section 422.33, subsection 5, Code 2017, and for purposes

  1 15    2.  The definition of "Internal Revenue Code" for purposes
  1 16 of sections 422.3 and 422.32, Code 2017, and for purposes of
  1 17 references in the 2017 Iowa Code and 2017 Iowa Acts to the
  1 18 definition of "Internal Revenue Code" in those sections, shall
  1 19 mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, prior to the date of
  1 20 its redesignation as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by the
  1 21 Tax Reform Act of 1986, or means the Internal Revenue Code of
  1 22 1986 as amended to and including January 1, 2017.
  1 23    Sec. 2.  DEDUCTION FOR STATE SALES AND USE TAX FOR
  1 24 2016.  Notwithstanding section 422.9, subsection 2, paragraph
  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,

  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 35    Sec. 5.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies
  3  1 retroactively to January 1, 2016.
  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue

  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,

  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the

  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual

  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal

  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  1 19 mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, prior to the date of
  1 20 its redesignation as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by the

  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is

  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.

  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make

  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income

  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or

  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,

  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 35    Sec. 5.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies
  3  1 retroactively to January 1, 2016.
  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those

  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 35    Sec. 5.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies
  3  1 retroactively to January 1, 2016.
  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the

  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other

  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make

  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,

  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",

  1 24 2016.  Notwithstanding section 422.9, subsection 2, paragraph
  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.

  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the

  1 19 mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, prior to the date of
  1 20 its redesignation as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by the
  1 21 Tax Reform Act of 1986, or means the Internal Revenue Code of

  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal

  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.

  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of

  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.

  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,

  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,

  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or

  1 16 of sections 422.3 and 422.32, Code 2017, and for purposes of
  1 17 references in the 2017 Iowa Code and 2017 Iowa Acts to the
  1 18 definition of "Internal Revenue Code" in those sections, shall
  1 19 mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, prior to the date of
  1 20 its redesignation as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by the
  1 21 Tax Reform Act of 1986, or means the Internal Revenue Code of
  1 22 1986 as amended to and including January 1, 2017.
  1 23    Sec. 2.  DEDUCTION FOR STATE SALES AND USE TAX FOR
  1 24 2016.  Notwithstanding section 422.9, subsection 2, paragraph
  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.

  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the

  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the

  1 24 2016.  Notwithstanding section 422.9, subsection 2, paragraph
  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.

  3  1 retroactively to January 1, 2016.
  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make

  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",

  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3

  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section

  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  1 23    Sec. 2.  DEDUCTION FOR STATE SALES AND USE TAX FOR
  1 24 2016.  Notwithstanding section 422.9, subsection 2, paragraph
  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.

  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,

  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of

  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  1 25 "i", Code 2017, the deduction for state sales and use taxes is
  1 26 allowable under section 422.9 for tax years beginning during
  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 35    Sec. 5.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies
  3  1 retroactively to January 1, 2016.
  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  1 27 the 2016 calendar year, but only if the taxpayer elected to
  1 28 deduct the state sales and use taxes in lieu of state income
  1 29 taxes under section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The
  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.

  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  1 30 deduction for state sales and use taxes is not allowed if the
  1 31 taxpayer has taken the deduction for state income taxes or
  1 32 claimed the standard deduction under section 63 of the Internal
  1 33 Revenue Code.
  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,

  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this

  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,

  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  1 34    Sec. 3.  BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR 2016.
  1 35    1.  Notwithstanding section 1 of this Act, or any other
  2  1 provision of law to the contrary, the additional first=year
  2  2 depreciation allowance authorized in section 168(k) of the
  2  3 Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by Pub. L. No. 114=113,
  2  4 {143, does not apply in computing net income for state tax
  2  5 purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1, 2016.  If
  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,
  2 13 paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017, or described in section
  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 33    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 34 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.

  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on

  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue

  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to

  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that

  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code

  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,

  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through

  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross
  2  8 income or federal taxable income, as the case may be, then
  2  9 the taxpayer, when computing net income for purposes of the
  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make
  2 12 the adjustments described in section 422.7, subsection 39A,

  2 14 422.35, subsection 19A, paragraphs "a" through "c", Code 2017,
  2 15 as applicable.
  2 16    2.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.5,
  2 17 subsection 2, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), Code 2017,
  2 18 for purposes of the state alternative minimum taxable income
  2 19 calculation in section 422.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b",
  2 20 subparagraph (1), to the extent that any preference or
  2 21 adjustment is determined by an individual's federal adjusted
  2 22 gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross income is
  2 23 computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this section for
  2 24 tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  2 25    3.  In addition to the requirements of section 422.9,
  2 26 subsection 2, paragraph "h", Code 2017, for purposes of
  2 27 calculating the deductions in section 422.9 that are authorized
  2 28 under the Internal Revenue Code, and to the extent that
  2 29 any such deduction is determined by an individual's federal
  2 30 adjusted gross income, the individual's federal adjusted gross
  2 31 income is computed in accordance with subsection 1 of this
  2 32 section for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.

  2  6 the taxpayer has taken the additional first=year depreciation
  2  7 allowance for purposes of computing federal adjusted gross

  2 10 individual income tax under section 422.7 or the corporation
  2 11 income tax or franchise tax under section 422.35, shall make

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies

  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.

  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    Under current law, Iowa Code references to the Internal
  3  6 Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue Code in effect on
  3  7 January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax revisions made
  3  8 by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable for Iowa tax
  3  9 purposes for the 2016 tax year. This bill temporarily updates
  3 10 for 2016 certain Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue
  3 11 Code to make federal income tax revisions enacted by Congress
  3 12 in 2015 and 2016 applicable for a certain period of time,
  3 13 to allow the deduction for state sales and use tax, and to
  3 14 decouple with certain bonus depreciation provisions.
  3 15    INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.  The bill provides that
  3 16 notwithstanding several Code provisions as specified in the
  3 17 bill, the definitions of "Internal Revenue Code" in those Code
  3 18 provisions and, by internal reference, in other sections of the
  3 19 Iowa Code and Iowa Acts shall mean the Internal Revenue Code
  3 20 in effect on, or as amended to and including, January 1, 2017.
  3 21 This definition change applies only to the period beginning
  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax
  3 23 years beginning during the 2016 calendar year.
  3 24    The affected Code provisions include Code sections 422.3
  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the
  3 26 Code that governs corporate and individual income tax and the
  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.

  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.

  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those

  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.

  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through

  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of

  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take

  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take

  3 22 January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2016, and for tax

  3 25 and 422.32, general definition sections in the chapter of the

  3 27 franchise tax, and Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33,
  3 28 which contain references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  3 29 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  3 30 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  3 31 programs.
  3 32    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  3 33 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  3 34 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  3 35 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4  1 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4  2 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4  3 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4  4 the federal deduction permanent.  The bill allows the Iowa
  4  5 deduction for tax years beginning during the 2016 calendar
  4  6 year.
  4  7    BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The bill decouples, for Iowa income
  4  8 tax purposes for tax years ending on or after January 1,
  4  9 2016, from the federal additional first=year depreciation
  4 10 allowance in section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
  4 11 (bonus depreciation) which was modified and extended through
  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies

  4 12 2019 by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act
  4 13 of 2015.  Taxpayers who claim bonus depreciation for federal
  4 14 tax purposes are, for the applicable tax year, required to add
  4 15 such depreciation amounts back to Iowa net income, but are
  4 16 then allowed under existing state law to deduct the amount of
  4 17 depreciation that would otherwise be allowable under federal
  4 18 law, without regard to the bonus depreciation allowance.
  4 19    Under current law, taxpayers are in some instances required,
  4 20 when calculating alternative minimum tax under Code section
  4 21 422.5(2) and itemized deductions under Code section 422.9(2),
  4 22 to recompute their federal adjusted gross income to take
  4 23 into account the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 24 depreciation.  The bill provides that taxpayers must make those
  4 25 same adjustments to federal adjusted gross income for tax year
  4 26 2016 to account for the fact that Iowa has decoupled from bonus
  4 27 depreciation as described above.
  4 28    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 29 retroactively to January 1, 2016.
