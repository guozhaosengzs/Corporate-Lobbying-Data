EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


Under
current
law,
the
operator
of
a
motor
vehicle
who
4


encounters
a
stationary
vehicle
which
is
of
a
certain
type
and
5


which
is
displaying
certain
flashing
lights
must
approach
the
6


stationary
vehicle
with
due
caution
and
make
a
lane
change
if
7


possible
under
the
existing
safety
and
traffic
conditions.
8


If
a
lane
change
would
be
impossible,
prohibited
by
law,
or
9


unsafe,
the
operator
must
reduce
the
speed
of
the
vehicle
to
a
10


reasonable
and
proper
speed
for
the
existing
road
and
traffic
11


conditions
and
be
prepared
to
stop.
This
bill
expands
the
12


list
of
protected
stationary
vehicles
to
include
stationary
13


construction
vehicles,
and
permits
construction
vehicles
to
14


display
amber
flashing
lights.
15


A
violation
of
the
requirements
relating
to
approaching
16


stationary
vehicles
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
17


scheduled
fine
of
$100.
If
the
violation
causes
property
18


damage,
the
violation
is
punishable
by
suspension
of
the
19


violator’s
driver’s
license
for
90
days
in
addition
to
the
20


scheduled
fine.
If
the
violation
causes
bodily
injury,
the
21


violation
is
punishable
by
an
additional
fine
of
$500
and
22


suspension
of
the
violator’s
driver’s
license
for
180
days.
23


If
the
violation
causes
death,
the
violation
is
punishable
by
24


an
additional
fine
of
$1,000
and
suspension
of
the
violator’s
25


driver’s
license
for
one
year.
26


The
bill
amends
the
scheduled
fine
provision
to
separate
27


violations
relating
to
stationary
authorized
emergency
vehicles
28


from
violations
relating
to
stationary
nonemergency
vehicles.
