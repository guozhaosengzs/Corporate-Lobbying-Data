EXPLANATION
3


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
4


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
5


This
bill
adopts
by
reference
to
federal
law
a
definition
of
6


“biological
product”
and
defines
“interchangeable
biological
7


product”.
As
described
by
the
United
States
food
and
drug
8


administration,
a
“biological
product”
is
a
medical
product,
9


often
made
from
a
variety
of
natural
sources,
used
for
a
broad
10


range
of
diseases
or
conditions,
particularly
chronic,
serious,
11


or
life-threatening
conditions
such
as
cancer
and
rheumatoid
12


arthritis.
13


The
bill
provides
that
pharmacists
may
use
professional
14


judgment
to
distribute
an
interchangeable
biological
product
15


when
an
authorized
prescriber
prescribes
a
biological
product.
16


The
bill
requires
the
board
of
pharmacy
to
maintain
a
link
17


on
its
internet
site
to
the
current
list
of
all
biological
18


products
that
the
United
States
food
and
drug
administration
19


has
determined
to
be
interchangeable
biological
products.
20


The
bill
provides
that
a
pharmacist
may
not
dispense
21


an
interchangeable
biological
product
if
the
prescriber
22


specifically
indicates
that
no
product
selection
shall
be
made
23


or
the
person
presenting
the
prescription
indicates
that
only
24


the
specific
biological
product
prescribed
should
be
dispensed.
25


The
bill
requires
that
within
five
days
of
dispensing
an
26


interchangeable
biological
product,
a
pharmacist
must
make
27


an
entry
into
one
of
a
specified
type
of
electronic
records
28


systems
noting
the
name
and
manufacturer
of
the
biological
29


product.
According
to
the
bill,
such
an
entry
is
deemed
to
30


provide
notice
to
the
prescriber
if
done
electronically.
If
31


it
is
not
done
electronically,
the
pharmacist
must
otherwise
32


provide
the
name
and
manufacturer
of
the
biological
product
to
33


the
prescriber.
Such
communication
is
not
required
if
a
refill
34


prescription
is
not
changed
from
the
product
dispensed
on
the
