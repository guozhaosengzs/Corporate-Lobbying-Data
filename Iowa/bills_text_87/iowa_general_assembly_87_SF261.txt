  1 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 19    This bill relates to the prohibitions under the smokefree
  1 20 air Act (Code chapter 142D).
  1 21    The bill amends the definition of "smoking" to include
  1 22 inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying any heated cigar,
  1 23 cigarette, pipe, or any other lighted or heated tobacco or
  1 24 plant product intended for inhalation, including hookahs and
  1 25 marijuana, whether natural or synthetic, in any manner or in
  1 26 any form. "Smoking" also includes the use of an electronic
  1 27 smoking device which creates an aerosol or vapor, in any manner
  1 28 or in any form, or the use of any oral smoking device.
  1 29    The bill also eliminates the exception under the smokefree
  1 30 air Act allowing smoking on the gaming floors of the premises
  1 31 licensed pursuant to Code chapter 99F (gambling structures,
  1 32 excursion gambling boats, and racetracks). The bill thereby
  1 33 subjects the entirety of these premises to the smoking
  1 34 prohibitions of the Act.
  1 35    Under Code chapter 142D, various penalties are applicable
  2  1 to violations relating to smoking. A person who smokes in an
  2  2 area where smoking is prohibited is subject to a civil penalty,
  2  3 which is a scheduled fine of $50.  A person who owns, operates,
  2  4 manages, or otherwise has custody or control of a public place,
  2  5 place of employment, area declared a nonsmoking place, or
  2  6 outdoor area regulated under Code chapter 142D and who fails
  2  7 to comply with the Code chapter is subject to a civil penalty
  2  8 ranging from an amount not to exceed $100 for a first violation
  2  9 to an amount not to exceed $500 for each additional violation
  2 10 in excess of a second violation in a year.  An employer who
  2 11 discharges or in any manner discriminates against an employee
  2 12 because the employee has made a complaint or has provided
  2 13 information or instituted a legal action under the Code chapter
  2 14 is subject to a civil penalty of not less than $2,000 and
