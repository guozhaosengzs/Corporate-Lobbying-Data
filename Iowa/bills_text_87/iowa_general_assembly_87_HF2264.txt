  1  9 provider as long as the network provider complies with Medicaid
  1 10 state plan requirements for that provider.  The rates in effect
  1 11 for each such provider on January 1, 2018, shall serve as the
  1 12 rate floor for such provider through June 30, 2019, unless the
  1 13 rate floors are otherwise amended or scheduled to be amended
  1 14 by law.  The department of human services shall adopt rules
  1 15 pursuant to chapter 17A and shall amend all Medicaid managed
  1 16 care contracts as necessary to administer this subsection.

  1 21 reimbursement and services delivery methodologies, for
  1 22 reconsideration of a Medicaid member's supports intensity scale
  1 23 (SIS) assessment score if a member, a member's authorized
  1 24 representative, or a provider acting on behalf of the member
  1 25 disputes the accuracy or adequacy of the assessment score.
  1 26 The reconsideration process shall provide for an expedited
  1 27 first=level review by the applicable Medicaid managed care
  1 28 organization, followed by an appeals process in accordance
  1 29 with contested case proceedings pursuant to chapter 17A if the
  1 30 member, the member's authorized representative, or a provider
  1 31 acting on behalf of the member is dissatisfied with the notice
  1 32 of decision resulting from the managed care organization's
  1 33 review.  The rules adopted and the amendment to any Medicaid
  1 34 managed care contract shall require that the expedited
  1 35 first=level review be completed and the notice of decision
  2  1 be issued by the managed care organization within 30 days of
  2  2 receipt by the managed care organization of the request for
  2  3 reconsideration.
  2  4    3.  The department of human services and all Medicaid managed
  2  5 care organizations under contract with the state shall maintain

  2 13 organization or the department determines that the member was
  2 14 not eligible for such services and if the provider of services
  2 15 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  2 16 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time
  2 17 the services were rendered.  The department of human services
  2 18 shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A and shall amend all
  2 19 Medicaid managed care contracts to administer this subsection.
  2 20    4.  The department of human services shall adopt rules
  2 21 pursuant to chapter 17A and shall amend all Medicaid managed
  2 22 care contracts to provide that if a Medicaid member prevails in
  2 23 a first=level review by the Medicaid managed care organization
  2 24 or on appeal in an action regarding provision of services, the
  2 25 services subject to the review or appeal shall be extended for
  2 26 not less than six months following the date of the decision.

  3 11 unless the rate floors are amended or scheduled to be amended
  3 12 by law.
  3 13    With regard to supports intensity scale (SIS) assessments,
  3 14 the bill requires provision of a process, under both Medicaid
  3 15 fee=for=service and managed care for reconsideration of
  3 16 a Medicaid member's SIS assessment score if a member, a
  3 17 member's authorized representative, or a provider acting on

  3 19 assessment score. The reconsideration process must provide
  3 20 for an expedited first=level review by the applicable MCO

  3 34 denied payment for services rendered.  Additionally, under
  3 35 such circumstances, DHS and the MCOs are prohibited from not
  4  1 paying or recouping payments to such providers if, subsequent
  4  2 to the provision of services, DHS or an MCO determines that the
  4  3 member was not eligible for such services and if the provider
  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for
  4 11 not less than six months following the date of the decision.
  4 12 However, the services are not required to be extended if there
  4 13 is a change in the member's condition that warrants a change
  4 14 in services as determined by the member's interdisciplinary
  4 15 team, there is a change in the member's eligibility status as
  4 16 determined by DHS, or the member voluntarily withdraws from
  4 17 services.

  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for
  4 11 not less than six months following the date of the decision.

  2 32                           EXPLANATION
  2 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 35    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight.
  3  1 With regard to network adequacy, the bill requires that the
  3  2 network of long=term services and supports providers under
  3  3 contract with each managed care organization (MCO) on January
  3  4 1, 2018, shall be deemed necessary to meet the requirement
  3  5 for network adequacy, and any willing provider under contract
  3  6 on that date shall remain a network provider as long as the
  3  7 network provider remains in compliance with Medicaid state plan
  3  8 requirements for that provider.  Additionally, the rates in
  3  9 effect for each such provider on January 1, 2018, shall serve
  3 10 as the rate floor for such provider through June 30, 2019,
  3 11 unless the rate floors are amended or scheduled to be amended
  3 12 by law.
  3 13    With regard to supports intensity scale (SIS) assessments,
  3 14 the bill requires provision of a process, under both Medicaid
  3 15 fee=for=service and managed care for reconsideration of
  3 16 a Medicaid member's SIS assessment score if a member, a
  3 17 member's authorized representative, or a provider acting on
  3 18 behalf of the member disputes the accuracy or adequacy of the
  3 19 assessment score. The reconsideration process must provide
  3 20 for an expedited first=level review by the applicable MCO
  3 21 followed by an appeals process in accordance with contested
  3 22 case proceedings if the member, the member's authorized
  3 23 representative, or a provider acting on behalf of the member
  3 24 is dissatisfied with the notice of decision resulting from
  3 25 the MCO's review.  The expedited first=level review must be
  3 26 completed and the notice of decision must be issued by the MCO
  3 27 within 30 days of receipt of the request for reconsideration.
  3 28    With regard to Medicaid member eligibility, the bill
  3 29 requires the department of human services (DHS) and all MCOs
  3 30 under contract with the state to maintain and update member

  3 32 who, in good faith, provide services to members in accordance
  3 33 with service plans and reimbursement agreements shall not be
  3 34 denied payment for services rendered.  Additionally, under
  3 35 such circumstances, DHS and the MCOs are prohibited from not
  4  1 paying or recouping payments to such providers if, subsequent
  4  2 to the provision of services, DHS or an MCO determines that the
  4  3 member was not eligible for such services and if the provider
  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for
  4 11 not less than six months following the date of the decision.
  4 12 However, the services are not required to be extended if there
  4 13 is a change in the member's condition that warrants a change
  4 14 in services as determined by the member's interdisciplinary
  4 15 team, there is a change in the member's eligibility status as
  4 16 determined by DHS, or the member voluntarily withdraws from
  4 17 services.
  4 18    With regard to each requirement or provision under the
  4 19 bill, DHS is required to adopt administrative rules and amend
  4 20 Medicaid managed care contracts to administer the requirement
  4 21 or provision.

  2 32                           EXPLANATION
  2 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 35    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight.
  3  1 With regard to network adequacy, the bill requires that the
  3  2 network of long=term services and supports providers under
  3  3 contract with each managed care organization (MCO) on January
  3  4 1, 2018, shall be deemed necessary to meet the requirement
  3  5 for network adequacy, and any willing provider under contract
  3  6 on that date shall remain a network provider as long as the
  3  7 network provider remains in compliance with Medicaid state plan
  3  8 requirements for that provider.  Additionally, the rates in
  3  9 effect for each such provider on January 1, 2018, shall serve
  3 10 as the rate floor for such provider through June 30, 2019,
  3 11 unless the rate floors are amended or scheduled to be amended
  3 12 by law.
  3 13    With regard to supports intensity scale (SIS) assessments,
  3 14 the bill requires provision of a process, under both Medicaid
  3 15 fee=for=service and managed care for reconsideration of
  3 16 a Medicaid member's SIS assessment score if a member, a
  3 17 member's authorized representative, or a provider acting on
  3 18 behalf of the member disputes the accuracy or adequacy of the
  3 19 assessment score. The reconsideration process must provide
  3 20 for an expedited first=level review by the applicable MCO
  3 21 followed by an appeals process in accordance with contested
  3 22 case proceedings if the member, the member's authorized
  3 23 representative, or a provider acting on behalf of the member
  3 24 is dissatisfied with the notice of decision resulting from
  3 25 the MCO's review.  The expedited first=level review must be
  3 26 completed and the notice of decision must be issued by the MCO
  3 27 within 30 days of receipt of the request for reconsideration.
  3 28    With regard to Medicaid member eligibility, the bill
  3 29 requires the department of human services (DHS) and all MCOs
  3 30 under contract with the state to maintain and update member
  3 31 eligibility files in a timely manner. Medicaid providers
  3 32 who, in good faith, provide services to members in accordance
  3 33 with service plans and reimbursement agreements shall not be
  3 34 denied payment for services rendered.  Additionally, under
  3 35 such circumstances, DHS and the MCOs are prohibited from not
  4  1 paying or recouping payments to such providers if, subsequent
  4  2 to the provision of services, DHS or an MCO determines that the
  4  3 member was not eligible for such services and if the provider
  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for
  4 11 not less than six months following the date of the decision.
  4 12 However, the services are not required to be extended if there
  4 13 is a change in the member's condition that warrants a change
  4 14 in services as determined by the member's interdisciplinary
  4 15 team, there is a change in the member's eligibility status as
  4 16 determined by DHS, or the member voluntarily withdraws from
  4 17 services.
  4 18    With regard to each requirement or provision under the
  4 19 bill, DHS is required to adopt administrative rules and amend
  4 20 Medicaid managed care contracts to administer the requirement
  4 21 or provision.

  1 24 representative, or a provider acting on behalf of the member
  1 25 disputes the accuracy or adequacy of the assessment score.
  1 26 The reconsideration process shall provide for an expedited
  1 27 first=level review by the applicable Medicaid managed care
  1 28 organization, followed by an appeals process in accordance
  1 29 with contested case proceedings pursuant to chapter 17A if the
  1 30 member, the member's authorized representative, or a provider
  1 31 acting on behalf of the member is dissatisfied with the notice
  1 32 of decision resulting from the managed care organization's
  1 33 review.  The rules adopted and the amendment to any Medicaid

  2 15 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  2 16 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time
  2 17 the services were rendered.  The department of human services
  2 18 shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A and shall amend all
  2 19 Medicaid managed care contracts to administer this subsection.
  2 20    4.  The department of human services shall adopt rules
  2 21 pursuant to chapter 17A and shall amend all Medicaid managed
  2 22 care contracts to provide that if a Medicaid member prevails in
  2 23 a first=level review by the Medicaid managed care organization
  2 24 or on appeal in an action regarding provision of services, the
  2 25 services subject to the review or appeal shall be extended for
  2 26 not less than six months following the date of the decision.

  4  1 paying or recouping payments to such providers if, subsequent
  4  2 to the provision of services, DHS or an MCO determines that the
  4  3 member was not eligible for such services and if the provider
  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for
  4 11 not less than six months following the date of the decision.
  4 12 However, the services are not required to be extended if there
  4 13 is a change in the member's condition that warrants a change
  4 14 in services as determined by the member's interdisciplinary
  4 15 team, there is a change in the member's eligibility status as
  4 16 determined by DHS, or the member voluntarily withdraws from
  4 17 services.
  4 18    With regard to each requirement or provision under the
  4 19 bill, DHS is required to adopt administrative rules and amend
  4 20 Medicaid managed care contracts to administer the requirement

  2 32                           EXPLANATION
  2 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 35    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight.
  3  1 With regard to network adequacy, the bill requires that the
  3  2 network of long=term services and supports providers under
  3  3 contract with each managed care organization (MCO) on January

  3  5 for network adequacy, and any willing provider under contract
  3  6 on that date shall remain a network provider as long as the
  3  7 network provider remains in compliance with Medicaid state plan
  3  8 requirements for that provider.  Additionally, the rates in
  3  9 effect for each such provider on January 1, 2018, shall serve
  3 10 as the rate floor for such provider through June 30, 2019,
  3 11 unless the rate floors are amended or scheduled to be amended
  3 12 by law.
  3 13    With regard to supports intensity scale (SIS) assessments,
  3 14 the bill requires provision of a process, under both Medicaid
  3 15 fee=for=service and managed care for reconsideration of
  3 16 a Medicaid member's SIS assessment score if a member, a
  3 17 member's authorized representative, or a provider acting on
  3 18 behalf of the member disputes the accuracy or adequacy of the
  3 19 assessment score. The reconsideration process must provide
  3 20 for an expedited first=level review by the applicable MCO
  3 21 followed by an appeals process in accordance with contested
  3 22 case proceedings if the member, the member's authorized
  3 23 representative, or a provider acting on behalf of the member
  3 24 is dissatisfied with the notice of decision resulting from
  3 25 the MCO's review.  The expedited first=level review must be

  3 27 within 30 days of receipt of the request for reconsideration.
  3 28    With regard to Medicaid member eligibility, the bill

  3 32 who, in good faith, provide services to members in accordance
  3 33 with service plans and reimbursement agreements shall not be
  3 34 denied payment for services rendered.  Additionally, under
  3 35 such circumstances, DHS and the MCOs are prohibited from not
  4  1 paying or recouping payments to such providers if, subsequent
  4  2 to the provision of services, DHS or an MCO determines that the
  4  3 member was not eligible for such services and if the provider
  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for
  4 11 not less than six months following the date of the decision.
  4 12 However, the services are not required to be extended if there
  4 13 is a change in the member's condition that warrants a change
  4 14 in services as determined by the member's interdisciplinary
  4 15 team, there is a change in the member's eligibility status as
  4 16 determined by DHS, or the member voluntarily withdraws from
  4 17 services.
  4 18    With regard to each requirement or provision under the
  4 19 bill, DHS is required to adopt administrative rules and amend
  4 20 Medicaid managed care contracts to administer the requirement
  4 21 or provision.

  3 13    With regard to supports intensity scale (SIS) assessments,
  3 14 the bill requires provision of a process, under both Medicaid
  3 15 fee=for=service and managed care for reconsideration of
  3 16 a Medicaid member's SIS assessment score if a member, a

  3 34 denied payment for services rendered.  Additionally, under
  3 35 such circumstances, DHS and the MCOs are prohibited from not
  4  1 paying or recouping payments to such providers if, subsequent
  4  2 to the provision of services, DHS or an MCO determines that the
  4  3 member was not eligible for such services and if the provider
  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for

  3 13    With regard to supports intensity scale (SIS) assessments,
  3 14 the bill requires provision of a process, under both Medicaid
  3 15 fee=for=service and managed care for reconsideration of
  3 16 a Medicaid member's SIS assessment score if a member, a
  3 17 member's authorized representative, or a provider acting on

  3 19 assessment score. The reconsideration process must provide
  3 20 for an expedited first=level review by the applicable MCO

  3 34 denied payment for services rendered.  Additionally, under
  3 35 such circumstances, DHS and the MCOs are prohibited from not
  4  1 paying or recouping payments to such providers if, subsequent
  4  2 to the provision of services, DHS or an MCO determines that the
  4  3 member was not eligible for such services and if the provider
  4  4 is able to demonstrate, based on the information available to
  4  5 the provider, that the services were authorized at the time the
  4  6 services were rendered.
  4  7    With regard to member appeals regarding the provision of
  4  8 services, the bill also requires that if a Medicaid member
  4  9 prevails in a first=level review by the MCO or on appeal, the
  4 10 services subject to the review or appeal must be extended for
  4 11 not less than six months following the date of the decision.
  4 12 However, the services are not required to be extended if there
  4 13 is a change in the member's condition that warrants a change
  4 14 in services as determined by the member's interdisciplinary
  4 15 team, there is a change in the member's eligibility status as
  4 16 determined by DHS, or the member voluntarily withdraws from
  4 17 services.
