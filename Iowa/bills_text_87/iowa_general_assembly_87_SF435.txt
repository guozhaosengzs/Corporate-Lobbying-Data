 14 16                           EXPLANATION
 14 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 19    This bill contains various provisions relating to workers'
 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create
 14 34 a private cause of action.
 14 35    Code section 85.23 requiring notice of injury and Code
 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended
 15  2 to define "date of the occurrence of the injury" to mean the
 15  3 date the employee knew or should have known that the injury was
 15  4 work=related.
 15  5    Code section 85.33(3) concerning an employee who is
 15  6 temporarily, partially disabled, is amended to include
 15  7 requirements for offers of temporary work by employers
 15  8 to employees who are temporarily, partially disabled and
 15  9 requirements for refusal of such work as not suitable by an
 15 10 employee.  An employee cannot raise suitability as a reason
 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language
 15 23 providing compensation for a scheduled injury describing the
 15 24 whole rather than two=thirds of the upper arm.
 15 25    Code section 85.34(2)(u) concerning compensation for
 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total
 17 13 disability, healing period, or temporary partial disability
 17 14 to an employee against the liability of the employer for any
 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future
 18 17 payments of compensation, is amended to require that future
 18 18 payments may be commuted only upon application of a party
 18 19 to the workers' compensation commissioner and upon written
 18 20 consent of all parties to the proposed commutation or partial
 18 21 commutation.
 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at
 19 11 or from that place of business.  The statute is no longer
 19 12 applicable when the employer has a place of business in this
 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 16 in district court, is amended to provide that a timely petition
 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of
 19 34 an order or decision by the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 35 when a petition for judicial review is accompanied by the

 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid
 20  3 weekly workers' compensation payments, is amended to provide
 20  4 that instead of a 10 percent per year interest rate, interest
 20  5 shall accrue from the date each compensation payment is due at
 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
 20  9 2 percent.

 14 16                           EXPLANATION
 14 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 19    This bill contains various provisions relating to workers'
 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create
 14 34 a private cause of action.
 14 35    Code section 85.23 requiring notice of injury and Code
 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended
 15  2 to define "date of the occurrence of the injury" to mean the
 15  3 date the employee knew or should have known that the injury was
 15  4 work=related.
 15  5    Code section 85.33(3) concerning an employee who is
 15  6 temporarily, partially disabled, is amended to include
 15  7 requirements for offers of temporary work by employers
 15  8 to employees who are temporarily, partially disabled and
 15  9 requirements for refusal of such work as not suitable by an
 15 10 employee.  An employee cannot raise suitability as a reason
 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language
 15 23 providing compensation for a scheduled injury describing the
 15 24 whole rather than two=thirds of the upper arm.
 15 25    Code section 85.34(2)(u) concerning compensation for
 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total
 17 13 disability, healing period, or temporary partial disability
 17 14 to an employee against the liability of the employer for any
 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future
 18 17 payments of compensation, is amended to require that future
 18 18 payments may be commuted only upon application of a party
 18 19 to the workers' compensation commissioner and upon written
 18 20 consent of all parties to the proposed commutation or partial
 18 21 commutation.
 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at
 19 11 or from that place of business.  The statute is no longer
 19 12 applicable when the employer has a place of business in this
 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 16 in district court, is amended to provide that a timely petition
 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of
 19 34 an order or decision by the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 35 when a petition for judicial review is accompanied by the
 20  1 posting of a bond.
 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid
 20  3 weekly workers' compensation payments, is amended to provide

 20  5 shall accrue from the date each compensation payment is due at
 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
 20  9 2 percent.

 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future
 18 17 payments of compensation, is amended to require that future
 18 18 payments may be commuted only upon application of a party
 18 19 to the workers' compensation commissioner and upon written
 18 20 consent of all parties to the proposed commutation or partial
 18 21 commutation.
 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at
 19 11 or from that place of business.  The statute is no longer
 19 12 applicable when the employer has a place of business in this
 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 16 in district court, is amended to provide that a timely petition
 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 19 35 when a petition for judicial review is accompanied by the
 20  1 posting of a bond.
 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid
 20  3 weekly workers' compensation payments, is amended to provide
 20  4 that instead of a 10 percent per year interest rate, interest
 20  5 shall accrue from the date each compensation payment is due at
 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
 20  9 2 percent.

 14 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 19    This bill contains various provisions relating to workers'
 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create
 14 34 a private cause of action.
 14 35    Code section 85.23 requiring notice of injury and Code
 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended
 15  2 to define "date of the occurrence of the injury" to mean the
 15  3 date the employee knew or should have known that the injury was
 15  4 work=related.
 15  5    Code section 85.33(3) concerning an employee who is
 15  6 temporarily, partially disabled, is amended to include
 15  7 requirements for offers of temporary work by employers
 15  8 to employees who are temporarily, partially disabled and
 15  9 requirements for refusal of such work as not suitable by an
 15 10 employee.  An employee cannot raise suitability as a reason
 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language
 15 23 providing compensation for a scheduled injury describing the
 15 24 whole rather than two=thirds of the upper arm.

 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total

 17 14 to an employee against the liability of the employer for any
 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for

 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total

 17 14 to an employee against the liability of the employer for any
 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future

 18 18 payments may be commuted only upon application of a party
 18 19 to the workers' compensation commissioner and upon written
 18 20 consent of all parties to the proposed commutation or partial
 18 21 commutation.
 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at
 19 11 or from that place of business.  The statute is no longer
 19 12 applicable when the employer has a place of business in this
 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 16 in district court, is amended to provide that a timely petition
 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 20  5 shall accrue from the date each compensation payment is due at
 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
 20  9 2 percent.
 20 10    The bill is effective upon enactment.

 14 16                           EXPLANATION
 14 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 19    This bill contains various provisions relating to workers'
 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create

 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended
 15  2 to define "date of the occurrence of the injury" to mean the

 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language

 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled

 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if

 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive

 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.

 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent

 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 15 25    Code section 85.34(2)(u) concerning compensation for
 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total
 17 13 disability, healing period, or temporary partial disability
 17 14 to an employee against the liability of the employer for any
 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future
 18 17 payments of compensation, is amended to require that future
 18 18 payments may be commuted only upon application of a party
 18 19 to the workers' compensation commissioner and upon written
 18 20 consent of all parties to the proposed commutation or partial
 18 21 commutation.
 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at
 19 11 or from that place of business.  The statute is no longer
 19 12 applicable when the employer has a place of business in this
 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 16 in district court, is amended to provide that a timely petition
 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of
 19 34 an order or decision by the workers' compensation commissioner

 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid
 20  3 weekly workers' compensation payments, is amended to provide
 20  4 that instead of a 10 percent per year interest rate, interest
 20  5 shall accrue from the date each compensation payment is due at
 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
 20  9 2 percent.

 14 16                           EXPLANATION
 14 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 19    This bill contains various provisions relating to workers'
 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create

 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended

 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that

 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language

 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment

 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay

 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any

 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if

 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive

 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as

 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such

 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.

 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns

 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation

 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any

 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs

 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive

 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.

 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer

 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for

 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting

 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an

 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.

 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide

 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to

 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus

 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of

 14 16                           EXPLANATION
 14 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 19    This bill contains various provisions relating to workers'
 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create
 14 34 a private cause of action.
 14 35    Code section 85.23 requiring notice of injury and Code
 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended
 15  2 to define "date of the occurrence of the injury" to mean the
 15  3 date the employee knew or should have known that the injury was
 15  4 work=related.
 15  5    Code section 85.33(3) concerning an employee who is
 15  6 temporarily, partially disabled, is amended to include
 15  7 requirements for offers of temporary work by employers
 15  8 to employees who are temporarily, partially disabled and
 15  9 requirements for refusal of such work as not suitable by an
 15 10 employee.  An employee cannot raise suitability as a reason
 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language
 15 23 providing compensation for a scheduled injury describing the
 15 24 whole rather than two=thirds of the upper arm.
 15 25    Code section 85.34(2)(u) concerning compensation for
 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total
 17 13 disability, healing period, or temporary partial disability
 17 14 to an employee against the liability of the employer for any
 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future
 18 17 payments of compensation, is amended to require that future
 18 18 payments may be commuted only upon application of a party
 18 19 to the workers' compensation commissioner and upon written
 18 20 consent of all parties to the proposed commutation or partial
 18 21 commutation.
 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at
 19 11 or from that place of business.  The statute is no longer
 19 12 applicable when the employer has a place of business in this
 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 16 in district court, is amended to provide that a timely petition
 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of
 19 34 an order or decision by the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 35 when a petition for judicial review is accompanied by the
 20  1 posting of a bond.
 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid
 20  3 weekly workers' compensation payments, is amended to provide
 20  4 that instead of a 10 percent per year interest rate, interest
 20  5 shall accrue from the date each compensation payment is due at
 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
 20  9 2 percent.
 20 10    The bill is effective upon enactment.
 20 11    The sections of the bill amending Code sections 85.16,
 20 12 85.18, 85.23, 85.26, 85.33, 85.34, 85.39, 85.61, 85.71, 86.26,
 20 13 86.39, and 86.42 apply to injuries occurring on or after the
 20 14 effective date of the bill.

 14 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 19    This bill contains various provisions relating to workers'
 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create
 14 34 a private cause of action.
 14 35    Code section 85.23 requiring notice of injury and Code
 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended
 15  2 to define "date of the occurrence of the injury" to mean the
 15  3 date the employee knew or should have known that the injury was
 15  4 work=related.
 15  5    Code section 85.33(3) concerning an employee who is
 15  6 temporarily, partially disabled, is amended to include
 15  7 requirements for offers of temporary work by employers
 15  8 to employees who are temporarily, partially disabled and
 15  9 requirements for refusal of such work as not suitable by an
 15 10 employee.  An employee cannot raise suitability as a reason
 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language
 15 23 providing compensation for a scheduled injury describing the
 15 24 whole rather than two=thirds of the upper arm.
 15 25    Code section 85.34(2)(u) concerning compensation for
 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total
 17 13 disability, healing period, or temporary partial disability
 17 14 to an employee against the liability of the employer for any
 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future
 18 17 payments of compensation, is amended to require that future
 18 18 payments may be commuted only upon application of a party
 18 19 to the workers' compensation commissioner and upon written
 18 20 consent of all parties to the proposed commutation or partial
 18 21 commutation.
 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at
 19 11 or from that place of business.  The statute is no longer
 19 12 applicable when the employer has a place of business in this
 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 16 in district court, is amended to provide that a timely petition
 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of
 19 34 an order or decision by the workers' compensation commissioner
 19 35 when a petition for judicial review is accompanied by the
 20  1 posting of a bond.
 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid
 20  3 weekly workers' compensation payments, is amended to provide
 20  4 that instead of a 10 percent per year interest rate, interest
 20  5 shall accrue from the date each compensation payment is due at
 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
 20  9 2 percent.
 20 10    The bill is effective upon enactment.
 20 11    The sections of the bill amending Code sections 85.16,
 20 12 85.18, 85.23, 85.26, 85.33, 85.34, 85.39, 85.61, 85.71, 86.26,
 20 13 86.39, and 86.42 apply to injuries occurring on or after the
 20 14 effective date of the bill.

 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid

 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus

 14 20 compensation.
 14 21    Code section 85.16(2) is amended to provide that if an
 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create
 14 34 a private cause of action.
 14 35    Code section 85.23 requiring notice of injury and Code
 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended

 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language

 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay
 16 13 testimony or agency expertise cannot be utilized in making this
 16 14 determination.
 16 15    New Code section 85.34(2)(x) provides that compensation for
 16 16 permanent partial disability for an injury terminates on the
 16 17 date when compensation for permanent total disability for any
 16 18 injury begins.  An employee shall not receive compensation
 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer

 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.
 18 16    Code section 85.45(1), relating to commutations of future

 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for
 19  8 injuries that occur outside of the state, is amended to provide
 19  9 that Iowa law is applicable if the employer has a place of
 19 10 business in this state and the employee regularly works at

 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to

 14 22 employer shows that at the time of an injury for which workers'
 14 23 compensation is sought, an employee had positive test results
 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create
 14 34 a private cause of action.

 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended

 15  3 date the employee knew or should have known that the injury was

 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that
 15 17 the extent of loss or percentage of permanent impairment can be
 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule
 15 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A.
 15 22    Code section 85.34(2)(m) is amended to modify language

 15 26 permanent partial disability for injuries other than scheduled
 15 27 injuries under Code section 85.34(2), paragraphs "a" through
 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining
 16  8 functional disability and not loss of earning capacity,
 16  9 shall be determined solely by use of the guides to the
 16 10 evaluation of permanent impairment, published by the American
 16 11 medical association, as adopted by the workers' compensation
 16 12 commissioner by rule pursuant to Code chapter 17A.  Lay

 16 19 for permanent partial disability if the employee is receiving
 16 20 compensation for permanent total disability.
 16 21    Code section 85.34(3)(a) is amended to provide that
 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent
 17  3 total disability for a week in which the employee is receiving
 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total

 17 15 future weekly benefits due for an injury to the employee.
 17 16    Code section 85.34(5) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for
 17 19 any future weekly benefits for permanent partial disability
 17 20 that is due for any current or subsequent injury to the
 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an

 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.

 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the
 18 34 agreement.
 18 35    Code section 85.61(7) is amended to provide that for
 19  1 purposes of the definition of "personal injury arising out of
 19  2 and in the course of business", an employee's injury must be
 19  3 found to be the predominant factor in causing the disability
 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for

 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'

 14 24 reflecting the presence of alcohol or drugs, there is a
 14 25 presumption that the employee was intoxicated at the time of
 14 26 the injury, and the intoxication was the predominant factor in
 14 27 causing the injury, making the injury not compensable.  The
 14 28 provision also allows the employee to overcome that presumption
 14 29 by establishing that the employee was not intoxicated or that
 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.
 14 32    Code section 85.18 is amended to provide that imposition of
 14 33 liability on any employer under Code chapter 85 does not create

 15  1 section 85.26(1) concerning limitations of actions, are amended

 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such
 15 15 compensation begins when it is medically indicated that maximum
 15 16 medical improvement from the injury has been reached and that

 15 18 determined by use of the guides to the evaluation of permanent
 15 19 impairment, published by the American medical association,
 15 20 as adopted by the workers' compensation commissioner by rule

 15 28 "t", is amended to provide that a reduction in the employee's
 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be
 16  2 paid based on the employee's resulting loss of earning capacity
 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination

 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),

 16 22 an employee can receive compensation for permanent total
 16 23 disability until the employee is no longer permanently and
 16 24 totally disabled or reaches the age of 67, whichever occurs
 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if
 16 30 compensation for an injury producing permanent disability has
 16 31 been paid to a person, the amounts so paid are deductible
 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.

 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 17 17 can receive credit for excess payments of any weekly benefits
 17 18 paid to an employee against the liability of the employer for

 17 21 same employee.  Provisions limiting the establishment of an
 17 22 overpayment and the availability of credit are stricken.
 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting

 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an

 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which

 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the

 14 30 intoxication was not the predominant factor in causing the
 14 31 injury.

 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.

 16 25 first.  If an employee is injured after reaching the age of
 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if

 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to

 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 16 26 67, compensation shall be paid so long as the employee remains
 16 27 permanently and totally disabled not exceed an amount equal to
 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if

 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is

 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to

 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is

 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to

 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to

 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting

 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is

 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.

 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to

 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.

 15 11 until such time as the refusal and reason are communicated to
 15 12 the employer in writing.
 15 13    Code section 85.34(2), concerning compensation for
 15 14 permanent partial disability, is amended to provide that such

 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.

 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is
 17  8 not entitled to compensation for a permanent total disability
 17  9 while the employee is receiving unemployment compensation under
 17 10 Code chapter 96.

 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting

 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is

 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which

 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the

 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the

 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of

 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the

 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an

 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to

 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.

 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to

 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section

 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area
 18 15 where the examination is conducted.

 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the

 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.

 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus

 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is

 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of

 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to

 15 29 earning capacity caused by a disability must take into account
 15 30 the employee's permanent partial disability and the number of
 15 31 years in the future it was reasonably anticipated the employee
 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the
 15 34 employee received when injured shall be compensated only for
 15 35 functional disability, and not in relation to earning capacity.
 16  1 If an employee is injured after age 67, compensation shall be

 16  3 not to exceed an amount equal to 150 weeks of compensation.
 16  4    New Code section 85.34(2)(w) provides that a determination
 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment
 16  6 for a scheduled injury pursuant to Code section 85.34(2),
 16  7 paragraphs "a" through "t", or paragraph "u" when determining

 16 28 150 weeks of compensation.
 16 29    Code section 85.34(3)(b) is amended to provide that if

 16 32 from the total amount of compensation payable to that person
 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee
 17  2 forfeits the employee's weekly compensation for a permanent

 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section

 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 22    New Code section 85.45(3) provides that the parties to any
 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the

 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the

 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.

 19 13 state and the employee is domiciled in this state.
 19 14    Code section 86.26, which allows judicial review of
 19 15 decisions or orders of the workers' compensation commissioner

 19 17 for judicial review, that is accompanied by a bond securing any
 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of

 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 19 35 when a petition for judicial review is accompanied by the
 20  1 posting of a bond.
 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid
 20  3 weekly workers' compensation payments, is amended to provide

 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus

 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of

 15 32 would work at the time of the injury.  An employee who returns
 15 33 to work or is offered work for the same or more money than the

 16  5 of the extent of an employee's loss or permanent impairment

 16 33 for permanent total disability.  An employee cannot receive
 16 34 compensation for permanent partial disability if the employee
 16 35 is receiving compensation for permanent total disability.
 17  1 New Code section 85.34(3)(c) provides that an employee

 17  4 a payment equal to or greater than 50 percent of the statewide
 17  5 average weekly wage from gross earnings from any employer or
 17  6 payment for services from any source.
 17  7    New Code section 85.34(3)(d) provides that an employee is

 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of

 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical
 18  6 examination requested by the employee if the injury for which
 18  7 the employee is being examined is found to be compensable under
 18  8 workers' compensation law.  An employer is not liable for the
 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to
 18 13 be determined based on the typical fee charged by a medical
 18 14 provider to perform an impairment rating in the local area

 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for

 17 10 Code chapter 96.
 17 11    Code section 85.34(4) is amended to provide that an employer
 17 12 can receive credit for excess payments of temporary total

 17 23    Code section 85.34(7)(a) relating to compensation of an
 17 24 employee in the case of successive disabilities is amended to
 17 25 provide that an employer is only liable for that portion of an
 17 26 employee's disability that relates to the injury that serves as
 17 27 the basis for the employee's claim for workers' compensation.
 17 28 An employer is not liable for compensating an employee's
 17 29 preexisting disability that arose out of and in the course of
 17 30 employment with the employer to the extent that the preexisting
 17 31 disability has already been compensated.  Code section
 17 32 85.34(7)(b) and (c) relating to compensation of preexisting or
 17 33 combined disabilities and successor employers are stricken.
 17 34    Code section 85.39, relating to medical examinations of
 17 35 injured employees for evaluation of permanent disability, is
 18  1 amended to provide that refusal of an employee to submit to an
 18  2 examination requested by the employer forfeits the employee's
 18  3 right to any compensation for the period of the refusal.
 18  4    Code section 85.39 is also amended to provide that an
 18  5 employer is only liable to reimburse an employee for a medical

 18  9 cost of the examination if the injury for which the employee
 18 10 is being examined is determined not to be a compensable
 18 11 injury.  An employer is liable to pay a reasonable fee for an
 18 12 examination requested by the employee with reasonableness to

 18 23 commutation or partial commutation of future compensation
 18 24 payments agreed to and ordered pursuant to this Code section
 18 25 may also agree that the employee has the right to benefits
 18 26 pursuant to Code section 85.27 under such terms and conditions
 18 27 as agreed to by the parties, for a specified period of time
 18 28 after the commutation or partial commutation agreement has been
 18 29 ordered by the workers' compensation commissioner. During that
 18 30 specified period of time, the commissioner has jurisdiction
 18 31 of the commutation or partial commutation agreement for
 18 32 the purpose of adjudicating the employee's entitlement to
 18 33 benefits provided for in Code section 85.27 as provided in the

 19  4 for which worker's compensation is claimed. An injury is the
 19  5 predominant factor in causing a disability if more than 50
 19  6 percent of the disability is attributable to the injury.
 19  7    Code section 85.71(1)(a), concerning compensation for

 19 18 compensation awarded pursuant to the order or decision as fixed
 19 19 and approved by the court, shall stay execution and enforcement
 19 20 of the decision or order.  Either party may object to the
 19 21 amount of the bond set by the court as being unreasonable or
 19 22 inadequate.
 19 23    Code section 86.39 is amended to provide that an attorney
 19 24 cannot recover fees for legal services based on the amount of
 19 25 workers' compensation voluntarily paid or agreed to be paid to
 19 26 an employee for temporary or permanent disability.  An attorney
 19 27 can only recover a fee based on the amount of compensation
 19 28 that the attorney demonstrates would not have been paid to the
 19 29 employee but for the efforts of the attorney.  Disputes over
 19 30 the recovery of attorney fees shall be resolved by the workers'
 19 31 compensation commissioner.
 19 32    Code section 86.42 is amended to refer to new Code section
 19 33 86.26(2) which allows a stay of execution and enforcement of

 20  2    Code section 535.3(1), concerning interest due on unpaid

 20  6 an annual rate equal to the one=year treasury constant maturity
 20  7 published by the federal reserve in the most recent H15 report
 20  8 settled prior to the date each compensation payment is due plus
