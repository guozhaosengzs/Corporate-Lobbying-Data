  1 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  1 Under current law, the operator of a motor vehicle who
  2  2 encounters a stationary vehicle which is of a certain type and
  2  3 which is displaying certain flashing lights must approach the
  2  4 stationary vehicle with due caution and make a lane change if
  2  5 possible under the existing safety and traffic conditions.
  2  6 If a lane change would be impossible, prohibited by law, or
  2  7 unsafe, the operator must reduce the speed of the vehicle to a
  2  8 reasonable and proper speed for the existing road and traffic
  2  9 conditions and be prepared to stop. Such stationary vehicles
  2 10 include authorized emergency vehicles, towing or recovery
  2 11 vehicles, utility maintenance vehicles, municipal maintenance
  2 12 vehicles, stationary highway maintenance vehicles, and solid
  2 13 waste or recycling collection service vehicles.
  2 14    This bill extends these requirements to include any
  2 15 stationary motor vehicle continually displaying its emergency
  2 16 signal lamps flashing simultaneously. A violation of the
  2 17 requirements is a simple misdemeanor punishable by a scheduled
  2 18 fine of $100. If the violation causes property damage,
  2 19 the violation is punishable by suspension of the violator's
  2 20 driver's license for 90 days in addition to the scheduled
  2 21 fine. If the violation causes bodily injury, the violation is
  2 22 punishable by an additional fine of $500 and suspension of the
  2 23 violator's driver's license for 180 days. If the violation
  2 24 causes death, the violation is punishable by an additional fine
  2 25 of $1,000 and suspension of the violator's driver's license for
  2 26 one year.
  2 27    The bill amends the scheduled fine provision to separate
  2 28 violations relating to stationary authorized emergency vehicles
  2 29 from violations relating to stationary nonemergency vehicles.
