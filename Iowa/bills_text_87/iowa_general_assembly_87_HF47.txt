  6  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  3    This bill amends the current duties of the college student
  6  4 aid commission, under Code section 261.2, by eliminating
  6  5 provisions requiring the commission to prepare and administer a
  6  6 state plan for a scholarship program, distribute informational
  6  7 material to elementary school children, and develop and
  6  8 implement a program to assist criminal offenders in applying
  6  9 for higher education assistance; by consolidating certain
  6 10 authorizations and responsibilities; by authorizing the
  6 11 commission to seek and administer higher education assistance
  6 12 programs under agreements with public and private entities;
  6 13 by striking redundancies relating to administration of the
  6 14 tuition grant and the all Iowa opportunity foster care grant
  6 15 programs; and by moving a provision within the Code section in
  6 16 order to improve the organization of the Code section, though
  6 17 the provision is also amended to require the commission to
  6 18 ensure that individuals benefiting from loan repayment attended
  6 19 postsecondary institutions that were eligible for federal
  6 20 student assistance and were in compliance with Code chapter
  6 21 261B.  The bill also makes conforming changes.
  6 22    The commission is currently required to prepare and
  6 23 administer a state plan for a scholarship program for
  6 24 deserving Iowa students matriculating in Iowa's postsecondary
  6 25 institutions.  The bill strikes the requirement for the
  6 26 state plan, though the Code sections establishing commission
  6 27 requirements relating to the Iowa state fair scholarship and
  6 28 the all Iowa opportunity scholarship program remain intact.
  6 29    Commission responsibilities that are provided for in
  6 30 other Code sections within the Code chapter, including
  6 31 responsibilities to administer the Iowa state fair scholarship,
  6 32 to distribute tuition grant funds appropriated by the general
  6 33 assembly, and to carry out licensing sanctions as appropriate,
  6 34 are added under the bill to Code section 261.2.
  6 35    Currently, the commission must develop and implement, in
  7  1 cooperation with the state board of regents, an educational
  7  2 program and marketing strategies designed to inform parents
  7  3 about the options available for financing a college education.
  7  4 The bill adds the treasurer of state and other constituencies
  7  5 to the entities with whom the commission must cooperate in
  7  6 developing and implementing the program and strategies.
  7  7    Currently, the commission must submit an annual report
  7  8 to the general assembly relating to loan forgiveness
  7  9 amounts issued, the recipients of loan forgiveness, and the
  7 10 institutions attended by the recipients.  The bill expands the
  7 11 requirement beyond loan forgiveness to require that the report
  7 12 include information relating to all assistance authorized under
  7 13 the Code chapter.
  7 14    The bill authorizes the commission to administer higher
  7 15 education assistance programs under agreements with public and
  7 16 private persons and entities; to accept appropriations, gifts,
  7 17 grants, or other aid from those public or private persons or
  7 18 entities; and to establish one or more funds in the state
  7 19 treasury under the control of the commission.  Moneys in such a
  7 20 fund do not revert to the general fund of the state and moneys
  7 21 earned as income, including as interest, from such a fund and
  7 22 other receipts remain in the fund until expended.
