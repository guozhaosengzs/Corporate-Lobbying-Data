  1  3    The department shall adopt rules to establish a notice
  1  4 of country of origin labeling program for beef and pork meat
  1  5 products, that includes muscle cuts of beef, muscle cuts of
  1  6 pork, ground beef, and ground pork sold in this state on
  1  7 a retail basis.  The rules shall be based on regulations
  1  8 requiring country of origin labeling for those products as
  1  9 published in the Federal Register, Vol. 74, No. 10, January
  1 10 15, 2009.  The department shall not adopt such rules until it
  1 11 obtains any necessary waiver from the United States department
  1 12 of agriculture or until necessary legislation authorizing the
  1 13 program is enacted by the United States Congress.  If the
  1 14 department determines that it requires state legislation prior
  1 15 to adopting any rules under this section, the department shall
  1 16 prepare and submit such legislation for the eighty=eighth
  1 17 general assembly prior to its first session convening. The
  1 18 department shall submit a report to the general assembly
  1 19 not later than January 1, 2019, detailing its progress in
  1 20 implementing this Act.

  1 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 24    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code chapter 191 that
  1 25 sets forth labeling requirements for food products as regulated
  1 26 by the department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS).
  1 27 The bill requires DALS to adopt rules to establish a notice
  1 28 of country of origin labeling program for beef and pork meat
  1 29 products sold in this state on a retail basis.  The rules must
  1 30 be based on United States department of agriculture regulations
  1 31 published in the Federal Register in 2009.  Congress enacted
  1 32 legislation that removed mandatory labeling requirements
  1 33 contained in those rules pursuant to the "Consolidated
  1 34 Appropriations Act, 2016" (Pub. L. No. 114=113).  The bill
  1 35 provides that DALS is not to adopt such rules unless it first
  2  1 obtains any necessary waiver by the United States department
  2  2 of agriculture or until legislation is enacted by the United
  2  3 States Congress granting any necessary authorization.  If DALS
  2  4 determines it requires state legislation to further implement
  2  5 the program, it is required to prepare such legislation for
  2  6 consideration by the 88th General Assembly during its first
  2  7 session.  DALS must submit a report to the general assembly
  2  8 not later than January 1, 2019, detailing its progress in
  2  9 implementing the bill's provisions.
  2 10    INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  DALS is authorized to restrain a person
  2 11 violating a provision in the Code chapter, including a rule

  1 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 24    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code chapter 191 that
  1 25 sets forth labeling requirements for food products as regulated
  1 26 by the department of agriculture and land stewardship (DALS).
  1 27 The bill requires DALS to adopt rules to establish a notice
  1 28 of country of origin labeling program for beef and pork meat
  1 29 products sold in this state on a retail basis.  The rules must
  1 30 be based on United States department of agriculture regulations
  1 31 published in the Federal Register in 2009.  Congress enacted
  1 32 legislation that removed mandatory labeling requirements
  1 33 contained in those rules pursuant to the "Consolidated
  1 34 Appropriations Act, 2016" (Pub. L. No. 114=113).  The bill
  1 35 provides that DALS is not to adopt such rules unless it first
  2  1 obtains any necessary waiver by the United States department
  2  2 of agriculture or until legislation is enacted by the United
  2  3 States Congress granting any necessary authorization.  If DALS
  2  4 determines it requires state legislation to further implement
  2  5 the program, it is required to prepare such legislation for
  2  6 consideration by the 88th General Assembly during its first
  2  7 session.  DALS must submit a report to the general assembly
  2  8 not later than January 1, 2019, detailing its progress in
  2  9 implementing the bill's provisions.
  2 10    INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  DALS is authorized to restrain a person
  2 11 violating a provision in the Code chapter, including a rule
  2 12 adopted by the agency by petition in the district court where
  2 13 the violation occurs for injunctive relief.
