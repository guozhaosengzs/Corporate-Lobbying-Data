  5 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 26    GENERAL.  This bill relates to drainage and levee districts
  5 27 (districts) under Code chapter 468, by increasing the number
  5 28 of members of a special governing body responsible for
  5 29 managing a district.  A special governing body includes a
  5 30 board of drainage administrators appointed by the county
  5 31 board of supervisors or joint board of supervisors and a
  5 32 board of trustees elected by a district's landowners.  The
  5 33 bill increases the number of appointed administrators or
  5 34 elected trustees from three to five. The bill also requires
  5 35 districts be divided into subunits (administrative areas or
  6  1 election districts) from which an administrator or trustee
  6  2 resides.  Finally, it provides for staggering the terms of
  6  3 office of successor administrators and trustees, and provides
  6  4 that existing boards must oversee the creation of the five new
  6  5 subunits and the board of trustees must supervise a subsequent
  6  6 election. These preparations must occur prior to January 1,
  6  7 2020.
  6  8    BACKGROUND == BOARD OF DRAINAGE ADMINISTRATORS AND BOARD OF
  6  9 TRUSTEES.  After a drainage district has been established by a
  6 10 county's board of supervisors or joint board of supervisors,
  6 11 the board may transfer its authority to an appointed board of
  6 12 county drainage administrators (Code chapter 468, subchapter
  6 13 I, part 4) or an elected board of trustees (Code chapter 468,
  6 14 subchapter II, part 3).  In the case of a district to be managed
  6 15 by a board of county drainage administrators, the board of
  6 16 supervisors must divide the county into three administrative
  6 17 areas (Code section 468.231).  In the case of a district that
  6 18 contains 20,000 acres or more, the county board of supervisors
  6 19 must divide the district into three election districts (Code
  6 20 section 468.504). One exception is when two or more districts
  6 21 share mutual territory and one district dissolves and cedes its
  6 22 jurisdiction to the other "overlying" district having 35,000 or
  6 23 more acres (Code chapter 468, subchapter III, part 3).  In that
  6 24 case, the overlying district may divide the district into five
  6 25 election districts, with two trustees serving on an at=large

  5 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 26    GENERAL.  This bill relates to drainage and levee districts
  5 27 (districts) under Code chapter 468, by increasing the number
  5 28 of members of a special governing body responsible for
  5 29 managing a district.  A special governing body includes a
  5 30 board of drainage administrators appointed by the county
  5 31 board of supervisors or joint board of supervisors and a
  5 32 board of trustees elected by a district's landowners.  The
  5 33 bill increases the number of appointed administrators or
  5 34 elected trustees from three to five. The bill also requires
  5 35 districts be divided into subunits (administrative areas or
  6  1 election districts) from which an administrator or trustee
  6  2 resides.  Finally, it provides for staggering the terms of
  6  3 office of successor administrators and trustees, and provides
  6  4 that existing boards must oversee the creation of the five new
  6  5 subunits and the board of trustees must supervise a subsequent
  6  6 election. These preparations must occur prior to January 1,
  6  7 2020.

  6  9 TRUSTEES.  After a drainage district has been established by a
  6 10 county's board of supervisors or joint board of supervisors,
  6 11 the board may transfer its authority to an appointed board of
  6 12 county drainage administrators (Code chapter 468, subchapter
  6 13 I, part 4) or an elected board of trustees (Code chapter 468,
  6 14 subchapter II, part 3).  In the case of a district to be managed
  6 15 by a board of county drainage administrators, the board of
  6 16 supervisors must divide the county into three administrative
  6 17 areas (Code section 468.231).  In the case of a district that
  6 18 contains 20,000 acres or more, the county board of supervisors
  6 19 must divide the district into three election districts (Code
  6 20 section 468.504). One exception is when two or more districts
  6 21 share mutual territory and one district dissolves and cedes its
  6 22 jurisdiction to the other "overlying" district having 35,000 or
  6 23 more acres (Code chapter 468, subchapter III, part 3).  In that
  6 24 case, the overlying district may divide the district into five
  6 25 election districts, with two trustees serving on an at=large

  5 27 (districts) under Code chapter 468, by increasing the number
  5 28 of members of a special governing body responsible for
  5 29 managing a district.  A special governing body includes a
  5 30 board of drainage administrators appointed by the county
  5 31 board of supervisors or joint board of supervisors and a
  5 32 board of trustees elected by a district's landowners.  The
  5 33 bill increases the number of appointed administrators or
  5 34 elected trustees from three to five. The bill also requires
  5 35 districts be divided into subunits (administrative areas or
  6  1 election districts) from which an administrator or trustee
  6  2 resides.  Finally, it provides for staggering the terms of
  6  3 office of successor administrators and trustees, and provides
  6  4 that existing boards must oversee the creation of the five new
  6  5 subunits and the board of trustees must supervise a subsequent
  6  6 election. These preparations must occur prior to January 1,

  6 18 contains 20,000 acres or more, the county board of supervisors
  6 19 must divide the district into three election districts (Code

  6 15 by a board of county drainage administrators, the board of

  6 18 contains 20,000 acres or more, the county board of supervisors
  6 19 must divide the district into three election districts (Code
  6 20 section 468.504). One exception is when two or more districts
  6 21 share mutual territory and one district dissolves and cedes its
  6 22 jurisdiction to the other "overlying" district having 35,000 or
