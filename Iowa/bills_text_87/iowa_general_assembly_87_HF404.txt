  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  4 14 year.
  4 15    2.  a.  For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, and
  4 16 each succeeding budget year, the department of management
  4 17 shall annually determine a statewide adjusted transportation
  4 18 costs per pupil that is not lower than the statewide minimum
  4 19 transportation costs per pupil. The statewide adjusted
  4 20 transportation costs per pupil shall be annually determined,
  4 21 by taking into account amounts appropriated under subsection
  4 22 3, for the purpose of providing transportation equity aid for
  4 23 those school districts with the highest transportation costs
  4 24 per pupil differential.
  4 25    b.  Each school district that satisfies the criteria of
  4 26 subsection 1 shall receive transportation equity aid in
  4 27 an amount equal to the school district's budget enrollment
  4 28 multiplied by the difference between the school district's
  4 29 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year and the
  4 30 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil for the
  4 31 budget year.
  4 32    c.  For purposes of this section:
  4 33    (1)  "Average transportation costs per pupil" means the same
  4 34 as calculated for districts under section 257.31, subsection
  4 35 17.
  5  1    (2)  "Statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil" means
  5  2 the lowest district average transportation costs per pupil
  5  3 among all school districts in the state.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  4 16 each succeeding budget year, the department of management
  4 17 shall annually determine a statewide adjusted transportation
  4 18 costs per pupil that is not lower than the statewide minimum
  4 19 transportation costs per pupil. The statewide adjusted
  4 20 transportation costs per pupil shall be annually determined,
  4 21 by taking into account amounts appropriated under subsection
  4 22 3, for the purpose of providing transportation equity aid for
  4 23 those school districts with the highest transportation costs
  4 24 per pupil differential.
  4 25    b.  Each school district that satisfies the criteria of
  4 26 subsection 1 shall receive transportation equity aid in
  4 27 an amount equal to the school district's budget enrollment
  4 28 multiplied by the difference between the school district's
  4 29 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year and the
  4 30 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil for the
  4 31 budget year.
  4 32    c.  For purposes of this section:

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning

  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by

  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base

  4 21 by taking into account amounts appropriated under subsection
  4 22 3, for the purpose of providing transportation equity aid for
  4 23 those school districts with the highest transportation costs
  4 24 per pupil differential.
  4 25    b.  Each school district that satisfies the criteria of
  4 26 subsection 1 shall receive transportation equity aid in
  4 27 an amount equal to the school district's budget enrollment
  4 28 multiplied by the difference between the school district's

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  4 18 costs per pupil that is not lower than the statewide minimum
  4 19 transportation costs per pupil. The statewide adjusted
  4 20 transportation costs per pupil shall be annually determined,
  4 21 by taking into account amounts appropriated under subsection
  4 22 3, for the purpose of providing transportation equity aid for
  4 23 those school districts with the highest transportation costs
  4 24 per pupil differential.
  4 25    b.  Each school district that satisfies the criteria of
  4 26 subsection 1 shall receive transportation equity aid in
  4 27 an amount equal to the school district's budget enrollment
  4 28 multiplied by the difference between the school district's
  4 29 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year and the
  4 30 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil for the
  4 31 budget year.
  4 32    c.  For purposes of this section:

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  4 22 3, for the purpose of providing transportation equity aid for
  4 23 those school districts with the highest transportation costs
  4 24 per pupil differential.
  4 25    b.  Each school district that satisfies the criteria of
  4 26 subsection 1 shall receive transportation equity aid in
  4 27 an amount equal to the school district's budget enrollment
  4 28 multiplied by the difference between the school district's
  4 29 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year and the
  4 30 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil for the
  4 31 budget year.
  4 32    c.  For purposes of this section:
  4 33    (1)  "Average transportation costs per pupil" means the same

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  4 19 transportation costs per pupil. The statewide adjusted
  4 20 transportation costs per pupil shall be annually determined,
  4 21 by taking into account amounts appropriated under subsection
  4 22 3, for the purpose of providing transportation equity aid for
  4 23 those school districts with the highest transportation costs
  4 24 per pupil differential.
  4 25    b.  Each school district that satisfies the criteria of
  4 26 subsection 1 shall receive transportation equity aid in
  4 27 an amount equal to the school district's budget enrollment
  4 28 multiplied by the difference between the school district's
  4 29 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year and the
  4 30 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil for the
  4 31 budget year.
  4 32    c.  For purposes of this section:
  4 33    (1)  "Average transportation costs per pupil" means the same
  4 34 as calculated for districts under section 257.31, subsection
  4 35 17.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50

 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the

 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  4 28 multiplied by the difference between the school district's
  4 29 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year and the
  4 30 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil for the
  4 31 budget year.
  4 32    c.  For purposes of this section:

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning

  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year

  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25

  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified

  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the

 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for

 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget

  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year

 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the

  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to

  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,

  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.

 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July

  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified

  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the

  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified

  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs

  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum

 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.

  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt

  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,

  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide

 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the

 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year

  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning

  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified

  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt

  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget

  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget

  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state

  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is

  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified

  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget

  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25

  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,

 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year

  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by

  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,

  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  7 27 budget year. If an amount appropriated for a budget year is
  7 28 insufficient to pay all transportation base funding payments,
  7 29 the department of management shall prorate such payment
  7 30 amounts.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  7 22 funding is available as provided in subsection 3, paragraph
  7 23 "c", subparagraph (1), each school district in the state shall
  7 24 receive a transportation base funding payment in an amount
  7 25 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  7 26 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil for the
  7 27 budget year. If an amount appropriated for a budget year is
  7 28 insufficient to pay all transportation base funding payments,
  7 29 the department of management shall prorate such payment
  7 30 amounts.
  7 31    5.  Transportation equity aid payments and transportation
  7 32 base funding payments shall be paid by the department at the
  7 33 same time and in the same manner as foundation aid is paid
  7 34 under section 257.16.

  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget

  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year

  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous

  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,

  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average

  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning

 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school

  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children

 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt

  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,

  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the

 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for

 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school

  8  7                           EXPLANATION
  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to
  8 12 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.
  8 27 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2022, the percentage is
  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide
  9 10 adjusted transportation costs per pupil that is not lower than
  9 11 the statewide minimum transportation costs per pupil. The
  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 31 beginning July 1, 2020, the appropriation is equal to 37.5
  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt

  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,

  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide

  9 12 statewide adjusted transportation costs per pupil shall be
  9 13 annually determined for the purpose of providing transportation
  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified

 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base
 11  2 funding payments under this section do not affect the receipt
 11  3 or amount of transportation assistance aid received by a school
 11  4 district from the school budget review committee under Code
 11  5 section 257.31(17), for transportation costs.

  8 10    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  8 11 a transportation equity program and requiring adjustments to

  8 13 districts.
  8 14    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  8 15 1, 2018, the department of management is required to reduce the
  8 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  8 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning
  8 25 July 1, 2020, the percentage is 37.5 percent. For the budget
  8 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, the percentage is 50 percent.

  8 28 62.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2023, the
  8 29 percentage is 75 percent. For the budget year beginning July
  8 30 1, 2024, the percentage is 87.5 percent. For the budget year
  8 31 beginning July 1, 2025, and each succeeding budget year, the
  8 32 percentage is 100 percent.
  8 33    The department of management is required to notify each
  8 34 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  8 35 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  9  1 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  9  2 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year
  9  3 following the adjustments imposed under the bill.
  9  4    The bill also establishes a transportation equity program to
  9  5 provide prioritized funding for school districts with average
  9  6 transportation costs per pupil that exceed the statewide
  9  7 minimum transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9  8 beginning July 1, 2018, and each succeeding budget year, the
  9  9 department of management is required to determine a statewide

  9 14 equity aid for those school districts with the highest
  9 15 transportation costs per pupil differentials. Each qualified
  9 16 school district receives transportation equity aid in an amount
  9 17 equal to the school district's budget enrollment multiplied by
  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  9 22 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  9 23 beginning July 1, 2018, the appropriation is equal to 12.5
  9 24 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 25 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 26 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 27 beginning July 1, 2019, the appropriation is equal to 25
  9 28 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 29 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 30 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year

  9 32 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
  9 33 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
  9 34 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
  9 35 beginning July 1, 2021, the appropriation is equal to 50
 10  1 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  2 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  3 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  4 beginning July 1, 2022, the appropriation is equal to 62.5
 10  5 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10  6 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10  7 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10  8 beginning July 1, 2023, the appropriation is equal to 75
 10  9 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 10 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 11 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 12 beginning July 1, 2024, the appropriation is equal to 87.5
 10 13 percent of the amount of total actual costs for all children
 10 14 transported in all districts used to calculate the state
 10 15 average transportation costs per pupil. For the budget year
 10 16 beginning July 1, 2025, and each budget year thereafter, the
 10 17 appropriation is equal to the amount of total actual costs for
 10 18 all children transported in all districts used to calculate
 10 19 the state average transportation costs per pupil. The bill
 10 20 appropriates moneys in the fund to the department of management
 10 21 for purposes of making transportation equity aid payments and,
 10 22 if sufficient moneys are available in the fund, transportation
 10 23 base funding payments.
 10 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if
 10 25 funding is available in the transportation equity fund, each
 10 26 school district in the state receives a transportation base
 10 27 funding payment in an amount equal to the school district's
 10 28 budget enrollment multiplied by the statewide minimum
 10 29 transportation costs per pupil. If an amount appropriated for
 10 30 a budget year is insufficient to pay all transportation base
 10 31 funding payments, the department of management is required to
 10 32 prorate such payment amounts.
 10 33    Transportation equity aid payments and transportation base
 10 34 funding payments received under the bill are miscellaneous
 10 35 income and must be deposited in the general fund of the school
 11  1 district. Transportation equity aid and transportation base

  8 18 formula. The amount of the reductions are phased in over eight
  8 19 budget years.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the
  8 20 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by a specified
  8 21 percentage of the state average transportation costs per pupil.
  8 22 For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, the percentage is
  8 23 12.5 percent. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  8 24 the percentage is 25 percent. For the budget year beginning

  9 18 the difference between the school district's transportation
  9 19 costs per pupil and the statewide adjusted transportation costs
  9 20 per pupil, as those terms are defined in the bill.
  9 21    The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
