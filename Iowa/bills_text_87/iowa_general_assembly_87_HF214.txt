  1 32                           EXPLANATION
  1 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 35    This bill relates to sex offender registration requirements,
  2  1 sexually violent predators, and the commission of the offense
  2  2 of child endangerment by a sex offender.
  2  3    Currently, a person required to register as a sex offender
  2  4 is not required to register while incarcerated including while
  2  5 placed in a jail, prison, penitentiary, juvenile facility,
  2  6 or other correctional institution or facility.  The bill
  2  7 changes the definition of "incarcerated" in Code chapter 692A
  2  8 to specifically exclude placement in an adult residential
  2  9 correctional or treatment facility that allows a resident to
  2 10 leave the facility for a portion of a day or days.  By excluding
  2 11 placement in a residential correctional or treatment facility
  2 12 from the definition of "incarcerated", a sex offender placed
  2 13 in an adult residential correctional or treatment facility is
  2 14 required to register as a sex offender while placed at such a
  2 15 facility.
  2 16    The bill changes the definition of "sexually violent
  2 17 predator" in Code chapter 692A (sex offender registry) to mean
  2 18 a person who has been determined to be a sexually violent
  2 19 predator pursuant to Code section 229A.7 (civil commitment
  2 20 of sexually violent predator). Code section 229A.2 defines
  2 21 "sexually violent predator" to mean a person who has been
  2 22 convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who
  2 23 suffers from a mental abnormality which makes the person likely
  2 24 to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually violent
  2 25 offenses, if not confined in a secure facility.  A sexually
  2 26 violent predator is classified as a tier III offender under
  2 27 Code chapter 692A and must register as a sex offender for life.
  2 28    Under the bill, a person who knowingly takes custody or
  2 29 control of a child or minor, or who knowingly has unsupervised
  2 30 access to a child or minor while required to register as a sex
  2 31 offender, commits child endangerment.  However, the bill does
  2 32 not apply to a person who is a parent or guardian of the child
  2 33 or minor, or to a person who is married to and living with a
  2 34 person who is the parent or guardian of the child or minor. The
  2 35 penalties for a person who commits child endangerment range
  3  1 from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "B" felony punishable
  3  2 by up to 50 years in prison.

  1 32                           EXPLANATION
  1 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 35    This bill relates to sex offender registration requirements,
  2  1 sexually violent predators, and the commission of the offense
  2  2 of child endangerment by a sex offender.
  2  3    Currently, a person required to register as a sex offender
  2  4 is not required to register while incarcerated including while
  2  5 placed in a jail, prison, penitentiary, juvenile facility,
  2  6 or other correctional institution or facility.  The bill
  2  7 changes the definition of "incarcerated" in Code chapter 692A
  2  8 to specifically exclude placement in an adult residential
  2  9 correctional or treatment facility that allows a resident to
  2 10 leave the facility for a portion of a day or days.  By excluding
  2 11 placement in a residential correctional or treatment facility
  2 12 from the definition of "incarcerated", a sex offender placed
  2 13 in an adult residential correctional or treatment facility is
  2 14 required to register as a sex offender while placed at such a
  2 15 facility.
  2 16    The bill changes the definition of "sexually violent
  2 17 predator" in Code chapter 692A (sex offender registry) to mean
  2 18 a person who has been determined to be a sexually violent
  2 19 predator pursuant to Code section 229A.7 (civil commitment
  2 20 of sexually violent predator). Code section 229A.2 defines
  2 21 "sexually violent predator" to mean a person who has been
  2 22 convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who
  2 23 suffers from a mental abnormality which makes the person likely
  2 24 to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually violent
  2 25 offenses, if not confined in a secure facility.  A sexually
  2 26 violent predator is classified as a tier III offender under
  2 27 Code chapter 692A and must register as a sex offender for life.
  2 28    Under the bill, a person who knowingly takes custody or
  2 29 control of a child or minor, or who knowingly has unsupervised
  2 30 access to a child or minor while required to register as a sex
  2 31 offender, commits child endangerment.  However, the bill does
  2 32 not apply to a person who is a parent or guardian of the child
  2 33 or minor, or to a person who is married to and living with a
  2 34 person who is the parent or guardian of the child or minor. The
  2 35 penalties for a person who commits child endangerment range
  3  1 from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "B" felony punishable
  3  2 by up to 50 years in prison.
