GENERAL.
This
bill
provides
for
the
regulation
of
a
number
2


of
noninsurance
business
transactions
and
associated
entities
3


by
the
insurance
division
(division)
of
the
department
of
4


commerce.
5


BLUE
SKY
LAW
——
GENERAL.
The
amended
provisions
include
6


sections
in
the
“Iowa
Uniform
Securities
Act”
which
is
7


sometimes
referred
to
as
the
“Blue
Sky
Law
(Code
chapter
8


502).
A
person
is
prohibited
from
offering
to
sell
or
selling
9


a
security
in
this
state
unless
it
is
registered
with
the
10


division,
exempt
from
registration,
or
a
federal
covered
11


security
regulated
under
federal
law
(Code
section
502.301).
12


The
bill
amends
provisions
that
are
closely
connected
to
13


two
federal
statutes:
the
“Securities
Act
of
1933”
and
the
14


“Securities
Exchange
Act
of
1934”
(for
citations,
see
Code
15


section
502.103)
as
administered
by
the
federal
securities
and
16


exchange
commission
(SEC).
The
SEC
works
in
close
cooperation
17


with
several
private
entities
including
the
financial
industry
18


regulatory
authority
(FINRA).
19


BLUE
SKY
LAW
——
CHANGE
IN
ORGANIZATION.
The
bill
strikes
20


references
to
the
national
association
of
securities
21


dealers
(NASD)
which
was
a
self-regulatory
organization
of
22


the
securities
industry
responsible
for
the
operation
and
23


regulation
of
the
NASDAQ
stock
market
and
over-the-counter
24


markets.
It
has
been
succeeded
by
FINRA,
a
not-for-profit
25


organization
recognized
by
federal
statute
to
regulate
26


broker-dealers
engaged
in
transactions
involving
the
purchase
27


and
sale
of
securities
for
their
own
account
or
for
the
account


28


of
others.

The

provisions
(Code
section

502.202(24))
that
currently
exempt
intrastate
crowdfunding
from
32


certain
Blue

Law
requirements,
including
the
registration
33


of
securities
(Code
sections

1


The
bill
revises
the
definition
of
“intermediary”
to
include
2


a
business
entity
that
satisfies
two
requirements:
(1)
be
3


registered
with
the
SEC
as
a
funding
portal
and
(2)
be
a
member
4


of
FINRA
(17
C.F.R.
§227.400).
Under
federal
law,
a
funding
5


portal
cannot
offer
investment
advice
or
recommendations
or
6


solicit
purchases
or
sales
of
securities,
or
handle
investor
7


assets
(17
U.S.C.
§78c(a)(80)).
8


Currently,
in
Iowa,
an
intermediary
is
limited
to
either
9


a
broker-dealer
registered
with
the
division
(Code
section
10


502.401)
or
a
business
entity,
such
as
a
corporation,
11


qualifying
as
an
“Iowa
crowdfunding
portal”
which
means
12


it:
(1)
is
registered
with
the
division,
(2)
is
organized
13


under
state
law,
(3)
is
engaged
exclusively
in
intrastate
14


crowdfunding
offers
and
sales
of
exempt
securities
in
this
15


state
through
an
internet
site,
and
(4)
does
not
operate
or
16


facilitate
a
secondary
market
in
securities.
The
bill
provides
17


that
an
Iowa
crowdfunding
portal
would
no
longer
be
required
to
18


be
organized
or
authorized
to
do
business
in
this
state
or
be
19


engaged
in
crowdfunding
exclusively
in
this
state.
Finally,
20


the
bill
increases
the
aggregate
amount
of
securities
that
21


could
be
sold
to
investors
by
an
issuer
acting
through
an
22


intermediary
during
the
12
months
prior
to
the
date
of
offer
or
23


sale
from
$1
million
to
$5
million.
24


BLUE
SKY
LAW
——
INTRASTATE
CROWDFUNDING.
“Crowdfunding”
25


refers
to
the
practice
of
raising
capital
to
finance
ventures
26


(e.g.,
start-ups
and
early
stage
companies)
by
attracting
27


investments
generally
from
small
contributors
purchasing
an
28


equity
position
(e.g.,
the
purchase
of
stock)
via
the
internet.
29


“Intrastate
crowdfunding”
refers
to
a
securities
transaction
30


that
is:
(1)
available
for
purchase
only
by
an
Iowa
resident
31


or
business
entity
having
its
principal
place
of
business
in
32


this
state
and
(2)
made
via
an
intermediary’s
internet
site.
33


The
bill
requires
the
business
entity
maintain
its
principal
34


place
of
business
in
this
state.

be
immune
from
liability
