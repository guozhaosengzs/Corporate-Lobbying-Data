  6 32    This bill creates a cytomegalovirus public health initiative
  6 33 including congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening
  6 34 requirements and a public education and awareness program.
  6 35    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7  1 attending health care provider to ensure that the parent of
  7  2 every newborn under the birthing hospital's, birth center's,
  7  3 or attending health care provider's care receives information
  7  4 regarding congenital CMV, including the symptoms of and
  7  5 birth defects caused by congenital CMV, the opportunity for
  7  6 screening prior to and after being discharged from the birthing
  7  7 hospital's, birth center's, or attending health care provider's
  7  8 care; and follow=up measures to detect and treat congenital
  7  9 CMV.
  7 10    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7 11 attending health care provider to ensure that every newborn
  7 12 delivered in a birthing hospital or birth center who fails the
  7 13 initial newborn hearing screening receives a congenital CMV
  7 14 saliva screening and that the parent of the newborn receives
  7 15 the results of the screening prior to being discharged from
  7 16 the birthing hospital's, birth center's, or attending health
  7 17 care provider's care.  The bill requires similar duties of a
  7 18 primary care provider who undertakes primary pediatric care
  7 19 of a newborn delivered in a location other than a birthing
  7 20 hospital or birth center. If the results of the congenital
  7 21 CMV screening are positive, the parent of the newborn shall
  7 22 be provided with information regarding options for minimizing
  7 23 the effects of congenital CMV  and the early follow=up and
  7 24 intervention options, treatment, and resources available for
  7 25 the newborn.  If the results of the congenital CMV screening
  7 26 are negative, the parent is to be provided with information
  7 27 regarding follow=up program resources to confirm whether the
  7 28 newborn has hearing loss and to provide for early intervention.
  7 29    The bill provides that the required congenital CMV saliva
  7 30 screening  does not apply if a parent objects to the screening.
  7 31 If a parent objects to the screening of a newborn, the birthing
  7 32 hospital, birth center, attending health care provider,
  7 33 or primary care provider shall document the refusal in the
  7 34 newborn's medical record and shall obtain a written refusal
  7 35 from the parent and report the refusal to the department of
  8  1 public health.
  8  2    Under the bill, the results of a congenital CMV screening
  8  3 shall be reported in a manner consistent with the reporting
  8  4 of the results of metabolic screenings and in accordance with
  8  5 rules adopted by the center for congenital and inherited
  8  6 disorders with the assistance of the department of public
  8  7 health. The bill is also to be administered in accordance with
  8  8 those rules.
  8  9    The bill also requires the center for congenital and
  8 10 inherited disorders, in collaboration with state and local
  8 11 health agencies and other public and private organizations,
  8 12 to develop and publish or approve and publish informational
  8 13 materials to educate and raise awareness of CMV and congenital
  8 14 CMV among women who may become pregnant, expectant parents,
  8 15 parents of infants, birthing hospitals, birth centers,
  8 16 attending health care providers, primary care providers, and

  8 18 required to provide the informational materials to a pregnant
  8 19 woman during the first trimester of the pregnancy, and the
  8 20 center for congenital and inherited disorders is required to
  8 21 make the informational materials available to attending health
  8 22 care providers upon request. The department of public health
  8 23 is required to publish the informational materials on its
  8 24 internet site.
  8 25    The bill provides that the rules adopted under the bill shall
  8 26 include protocols for the saliva screening for congenital CMV,
  8 27 depending upon the location of the delivery of the newborn.
  8 28 The protocols are also to determine whether a birthing
  8 29 hospital, a birth center, an attending health care provider,
  8 30 or a primary care provider is responsible for completion of
  8 31 the congenital CMV screening of a newborn depending upon the
  8 32 circumstances of the birth as well as the specific obligations
  8 33 of the birthing hospital, birth center, attending health
  8 34 care provider, primary care provider, lab, and other persons
  8 35 involved in the congenital CMV screening process.
  9  1 The bill makes conforming changes to the universal newborn
  9  2 and infant hearing screening section of the Code.
  9  3    The bill appropriates $100,000 from the general fund of the
  9  4 state to the department of public health for FY 2017=2018 for a
  9  5 grant to an Iowa=based nonprofit prenatal education program to

  6 29                           EXPLANATION
  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill creates a cytomegalovirus public health initiative
  6 33 including congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening
  6 34 requirements and a public education and awareness program.
  6 35    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7  1 attending health care provider to ensure that the parent of
  7  2 every newborn under the birthing hospital's, birth center's,
  7  3 or attending health care provider's care receives information
  7  4 regarding congenital CMV, including the symptoms of and
  7  5 birth defects caused by congenital CMV, the opportunity for
  7  6 screening prior to and after being discharged from the birthing
  7  7 hospital's, birth center's, or attending health care provider's
  7  8 care; and follow=up measures to detect and treat congenital
  7  9 CMV.
  7 10    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7 11 attending health care provider to ensure that every newborn
  7 12 delivered in a birthing hospital or birth center who fails the
  7 13 initial newborn hearing screening receives a congenital CMV
  7 14 saliva screening and that the parent of the newborn receives
  7 15 the results of the screening prior to being discharged from
  7 16 the birthing hospital's, birth center's, or attending health
  7 17 care provider's care.  The bill requires similar duties of a
  7 18 primary care provider who undertakes primary pediatric care
  7 19 of a newborn delivered in a location other than a birthing
  7 20 hospital or birth center. If the results of the congenital
  7 21 CMV screening are positive, the parent of the newborn shall
  7 22 be provided with information regarding options for minimizing
  7 23 the effects of congenital CMV  and the early follow=up and
  7 24 intervention options, treatment, and resources available for
  7 25 the newborn.  If the results of the congenital CMV screening
  7 26 are negative, the parent is to be provided with information
  7 27 regarding follow=up program resources to confirm whether the
  7 28 newborn has hearing loss and to provide for early intervention.
  7 29    The bill provides that the required congenital CMV saliva
  7 30 screening  does not apply if a parent objects to the screening.
  7 31 If a parent objects to the screening of a newborn, the birthing
  7 32 hospital, birth center, attending health care provider,
  7 33 or primary care provider shall document the refusal in the
  7 34 newborn's medical record and shall obtain a written refusal
  7 35 from the parent and report the refusal to the department of
  8  1 public health.
  8  2    Under the bill, the results of a congenital CMV screening
  8  3 shall be reported in a manner consistent with the reporting
  8  4 of the results of metabolic screenings and in accordance with
  8  5 rules adopted by the center for congenital and inherited
  8  6 disorders with the assistance of the department of public
  8  7 health. The bill is also to be administered in accordance with
  8  8 those rules.
  8  9    The bill also requires the center for congenital and
  8 10 inherited disorders, in collaboration with state and local
  8 11 health agencies and other public and private organizations,
  8 12 to develop and publish or approve and publish informational
  8 13 materials to educate and raise awareness of CMV and congenital
  8 14 CMV among women who may become pregnant, expectant parents,
  8 15 parents of infants, birthing hospitals, birth centers,
  8 16 attending health care providers, primary care providers, and
  8 17 others, as appropriate.  An attending health care provider is
  8 18 required to provide the informational materials to a pregnant
  8 19 woman during the first trimester of the pregnancy, and the
  8 20 center for congenital and inherited disorders is required to
  8 21 make the informational materials available to attending health
  8 22 care providers upon request. The department of public health
  8 23 is required to publish the informational materials on its
  8 24 internet site.
  8 25    The bill provides that the rules adopted under the bill shall
  8 26 include protocols for the saliva screening for congenital CMV,
  8 27 depending upon the location of the delivery of the newborn.
  8 28 The protocols are also to determine whether a birthing
  8 29 hospital, a birth center, an attending health care provider,
  8 30 or a primary care provider is responsible for completion of
  8 31 the congenital CMV screening of a newborn depending upon the
  8 32 circumstances of the birth as well as the specific obligations
  8 33 of the birthing hospital, birth center, attending health
  8 34 care provider, primary care provider, lab, and other persons
  8 35 involved in the congenital CMV screening process.
  9  1 The bill makes conforming changes to the universal newborn
  9  2 and infant hearing screening section of the Code.
  9  3    The bill appropriates $100,000 from the general fund of the
  9  4 state to the department of public health for FY 2017=2018 for a
  9  5 grant to an Iowa=based nonprofit prenatal education program to
  9  6 assist maternal health care providers in educating women who

  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill creates a cytomegalovirus public health initiative
  6 33 including congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening
  6 34 requirements and a public education and awareness program.
  6 35    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7  1 attending health care provider to ensure that the parent of
  7  2 every newborn under the birthing hospital's, birth center's,
  7  3 or attending health care provider's care receives information
  7  4 regarding congenital CMV, including the symptoms of and
  7  5 birth defects caused by congenital CMV, the opportunity for
  7  6 screening prior to and after being discharged from the birthing
  7  7 hospital's, birth center's, or attending health care provider's
  7  8 care; and follow=up measures to detect and treat congenital
  7  9 CMV.
  7 10    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7 11 attending health care provider to ensure that every newborn
  7 12 delivered in a birthing hospital or birth center who fails the
  7 13 initial newborn hearing screening receives a congenital CMV
  7 14 saliva screening and that the parent of the newborn receives
  7 15 the results of the screening prior to being discharged from
  7 16 the birthing hospital's, birth center's, or attending health
  7 17 care provider's care.  The bill requires similar duties of a
  7 18 primary care provider who undertakes primary pediatric care
  7 19 of a newborn delivered in a location other than a birthing
  7 20 hospital or birth center. If the results of the congenital
  7 21 CMV screening are positive, the parent of the newborn shall
  7 22 be provided with information regarding options for minimizing
  7 23 the effects of congenital CMV  and the early follow=up and
  7 24 intervention options, treatment, and resources available for
  7 25 the newborn.  If the results of the congenital CMV screening
  7 26 are negative, the parent is to be provided with information
  7 27 regarding follow=up program resources to confirm whether the
  7 28 newborn has hearing loss and to provide for early intervention.
  7 29    The bill provides that the required congenital CMV saliva
  7 30 screening  does not apply if a parent objects to the screening.
  7 31 If a parent objects to the screening of a newborn, the birthing
  7 32 hospital, birth center, attending health care provider,
  7 33 or primary care provider shall document the refusal in the
  7 34 newborn's medical record and shall obtain a written refusal
  7 35 from the parent and report the refusal to the department of
  8  1 public health.
  8  2    Under the bill, the results of a congenital CMV screening
  8  3 shall be reported in a manner consistent with the reporting
  8  4 of the results of metabolic screenings and in accordance with
  8  5 rules adopted by the center for congenital and inherited
  8  6 disorders with the assistance of the department of public
  8  7 health. The bill is also to be administered in accordance with
  8  8 those rules.
  8  9    The bill also requires the center for congenital and
  8 10 inherited disorders, in collaboration with state and local
  8 11 health agencies and other public and private organizations,
  8 12 to develop and publish or approve and publish informational
  8 13 materials to educate and raise awareness of CMV and congenital
  8 14 CMV among women who may become pregnant, expectant parents,
  8 15 parents of infants, birthing hospitals, birth centers,
  8 16 attending health care providers, primary care providers, and
  8 17 others, as appropriate.  An attending health care provider is
  8 18 required to provide the informational materials to a pregnant
  8 19 woman during the first trimester of the pregnancy, and the
  8 20 center for congenital and inherited disorders is required to
  8 21 make the informational materials available to attending health
  8 22 care providers upon request. The department of public health
  8 23 is required to publish the informational materials on its
  8 24 internet site.
  8 25    The bill provides that the rules adopted under the bill shall
  8 26 include protocols for the saliva screening for congenital CMV,
  8 27 depending upon the location of the delivery of the newborn.
  8 28 The protocols are also to determine whether a birthing
  8 29 hospital, a birth center, an attending health care provider,
  8 30 or a primary care provider is responsible for completion of
  8 31 the congenital CMV screening of a newborn depending upon the
  8 32 circumstances of the birth as well as the specific obligations
  8 33 of the birthing hospital, birth center, attending health
  8 34 care provider, primary care provider, lab, and other persons
  8 35 involved in the congenital CMV screening process.
  9  1 The bill makes conforming changes to the universal newborn
  9  2 and infant hearing screening section of the Code.
  9  3    The bill appropriates $100,000 from the general fund of the
  9  4 state to the department of public health for FY 2017=2018 for a
  9  5 grant to an Iowa=based nonprofit prenatal education program to

  6 34 requirements and a public education and awareness program.
  6 35    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7  1 attending health care provider to ensure that the parent of
  7  2 every newborn under the birthing hospital's, birth center's,
  7  3 or attending health care provider's care receives information
  7  4 regarding congenital CMV, including the symptoms of and
  7  5 birth defects caused by congenital CMV, the opportunity for
  7  6 screening prior to and after being discharged from the birthing
  7  7 hospital's, birth center's, or attending health care provider's
  7  8 care; and follow=up measures to detect and treat congenital
  7  9 CMV.
  7 10    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7 11 attending health care provider to ensure that every newborn
  7 12 delivered in a birthing hospital or birth center who fails the
  7 13 initial newborn hearing screening receives a congenital CMV
  7 14 saliva screening and that the parent of the newborn receives
  7 15 the results of the screening prior to being discharged from
  7 16 the birthing hospital's, birth center's, or attending health
  7 17 care provider's care.  The bill requires similar duties of a
  7 18 primary care provider who undertakes primary pediatric care
  7 19 of a newborn delivered in a location other than a birthing
  7 20 hospital or birth center. If the results of the congenital
  7 21 CMV screening are positive, the parent of the newborn shall
  7 22 be provided with information regarding options for minimizing
  7 23 the effects of congenital CMV  and the early follow=up and
  7 24 intervention options, treatment, and resources available for
  7 25 the newborn.  If the results of the congenital CMV screening
  7 26 are negative, the parent is to be provided with information
  7 27 regarding follow=up program resources to confirm whether the
  7 28 newborn has hearing loss and to provide for early intervention.
  7 29    The bill provides that the required congenital CMV saliva
  7 30 screening  does not apply if a parent objects to the screening.
  7 31 If a parent objects to the screening of a newborn, the birthing
  7 32 hospital, birth center, attending health care provider,
  7 33 or primary care provider shall document the refusal in the
  7 34 newborn's medical record and shall obtain a written refusal
  7 35 from the parent and report the refusal to the department of
  8  1 public health.
  8  2    Under the bill, the results of a congenital CMV screening
  8  3 shall be reported in a manner consistent with the reporting
  8  4 of the results of metabolic screenings and in accordance with
  8  5 rules adopted by the center for congenital and inherited
  8  6 disorders with the assistance of the department of public
  8  7 health. The bill is also to be administered in accordance with

  8 10 inherited disorders, in collaboration with state and local
  8 11 health agencies and other public and private organizations,
  8 12 to develop and publish or approve and publish informational
  8 13 materials to educate and raise awareness of CMV and congenital
  8 14 CMV among women who may become pregnant, expectant parents,
  8 15 parents of infants, birthing hospitals, birth centers,
  8 16 attending health care providers, primary care providers, and

  8 22 care providers upon request. The department of public health
  8 23 is required to publish the informational materials on its
  8 24 internet site.
  8 25    The bill provides that the rules adopted under the bill shall
  8 26 include protocols for the saliva screening for congenital CMV,
  8 27 depending upon the location of the delivery of the newborn.
  8 28 The protocols are also to determine whether a birthing
  8 29 hospital, a birth center, an attending health care provider,
  8 30 or a primary care provider is responsible for completion of
  8 31 the congenital CMV screening of a newborn depending upon the
  8 32 circumstances of the birth as well as the specific obligations
  8 33 of the birthing hospital, birth center, attending health
  8 34 care provider, primary care provider, lab, and other persons
  8 35 involved in the congenital CMV screening process.
  9  1 The bill makes conforming changes to the universal newborn
  9  2 and infant hearing screening section of the Code.
  9  3    The bill appropriates $100,000 from the general fund of the
  9  4 state to the department of public health for FY 2017=2018 for a
  9  5 grant to an Iowa=based nonprofit prenatal education program to

  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill creates a cytomegalovirus public health initiative
  6 33 including congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening
  6 34 requirements and a public education and awareness program.
  6 35    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7  1 attending health care provider to ensure that the parent of
  7  2 every newborn under the birthing hospital's, birth center's,
  7  3 or attending health care provider's care receives information
  7  4 regarding congenital CMV, including the symptoms of and
  7  5 birth defects caused by congenital CMV, the opportunity for
  7  6 screening prior to and after being discharged from the birthing
  7  7 hospital's, birth center's, or attending health care provider's
  7  8 care; and follow=up measures to detect and treat congenital
  7  9 CMV.
  7 10    The bill requires a birthing hospital, birth center, or
  7 11 attending health care provider to ensure that every newborn
  7 12 delivered in a birthing hospital or birth center who fails the
  7 13 initial newborn hearing screening receives a congenital CMV
  7 14 saliva screening and that the parent of the newborn receives
  7 15 the results of the screening prior to being discharged from
  7 16 the birthing hospital's, birth center's, or attending health
  7 17 care provider's care.  The bill requires similar duties of a
  7 18 primary care provider who undertakes primary pediatric care
  7 19 of a newborn delivered in a location other than a birthing
  7 20 hospital or birth center. If the results of the congenital
  7 21 CMV screening are positive, the parent of the newborn shall
  7 22 be provided with information regarding options for minimizing
  7 23 the effects of congenital CMV  and the early follow=up and
  7 24 intervention options, treatment, and resources available for
  7 25 the newborn.  If the results of the congenital CMV screening
  7 26 are negative, the parent is to be provided with information
  7 27 regarding follow=up program resources to confirm whether the
  7 28 newborn has hearing loss and to provide for early intervention.
  7 29    The bill provides that the required congenital CMV saliva
  7 30 screening  does not apply if a parent objects to the screening.
  7 31 If a parent objects to the screening of a newborn, the birthing
  7 32 hospital, birth center, attending health care provider,
  7 33 or primary care provider shall document the refusal in the
  7 34 newborn's medical record and shall obtain a written refusal
  7 35 from the parent and report the refusal to the department of
  8  1 public health.
  8  2    Under the bill, the results of a congenital CMV screening
  8  3 shall be reported in a manner consistent with the reporting
  8  4 of the results of metabolic screenings and in accordance with
  8  5 rules adopted by the center for congenital and inherited
  8  6 disorders with the assistance of the department of public
  8  7 health. The bill is also to be administered in accordance with
  8  8 those rules.
  8  9    The bill also requires the center for congenital and
  8 10 inherited disorders, in collaboration with state and local
  8 11 health agencies and other public and private organizations,
  8 12 to develop and publish or approve and publish informational
  8 13 materials to educate and raise awareness of CMV and congenital
  8 14 CMV among women who may become pregnant, expectant parents,
  8 15 parents of infants, birthing hospitals, birth centers,
  8 16 attending health care providers, primary care providers, and
  8 17 others, as appropriate.  An attending health care provider is
  8 18 required to provide the informational materials to a pregnant
  8 19 woman during the first trimester of the pregnancy, and the
  8 20 center for congenital and inherited disorders is required to
  8 21 make the informational materials available to attending health
  8 22 care providers upon request. The department of public health
  8 23 is required to publish the informational materials on its
  8 24 internet site.
  8 25    The bill provides that the rules adopted under the bill shall
  8 26 include protocols for the saliva screening for congenital CMV,
  8 27 depending upon the location of the delivery of the newborn.
  8 28 The protocols are also to determine whether a birthing
  8 29 hospital, a birth center, an attending health care provider,
  8 30 or a primary care provider is responsible for completion of
  8 31 the congenital CMV screening of a newborn depending upon the
  8 32 circumstances of the birth as well as the specific obligations
  8 33 of the birthing hospital, birth center, attending health
  8 34 care provider, primary care provider, lab, and other persons
  8 35 involved in the congenital CMV screening process.
  9  1 The bill makes conforming changes to the universal newborn
  9  2 and infant hearing screening section of the Code.
  9  3    The bill appropriates $100,000 from the general fund of the
  9  4 state to the department of public health for FY 2017=2018 for a
  9  5 grant to an Iowa=based nonprofit prenatal education program to
