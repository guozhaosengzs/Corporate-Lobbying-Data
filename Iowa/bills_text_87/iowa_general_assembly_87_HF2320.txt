  3  3    GENERAL.  This bill makes changes to statutes involving
  3  4 corporations operating on a for=profit basis under Code chapter
  3  5 490 (the "Iowa Business Corporation Act") or Code chapter 491,
  3  6 or on a nonprofit basis under Code chapter 504, the "Revised
  3  7 Iowa Nonprofit Corporation Act".
  3  8    NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS ==== RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
  3  9 CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL LAND HOLDINGS.  The bill amends Code
  3 10 chapter 9H which restricts certain business entities, including
  3 11 corporations, from acquiring agricultural land suitable for
  3 12 use in farming (Code section 9H.1(2)(14)).  The bill also
  3 13 amends related provisions in Code chapter 10B that require such
  3 14 entities to file landholding reports with the secretary of
  3 15 state (Code section 10B.1).  Specifically, the bill replaces
  3 16 language defining a nonprofit corporation as a business entity
  3 17 "organized under" former Code chapter 504 as published in the
  3 18 1989 edition of the Code (prior to its repeal) or current
  3 19 Code chapter 504 with language that adopt by reference the
  3 20 definition of a corporation as set forth in current Code
  3 21 chapter 504, including a domestic nonprofit corporation
  3 22 incorporated under its provisions and a foreign corporation
  3 23 authorized to transact business in this state (Code sections
  3 24 504.141 and 504.119). A domestic corporation incorporated
  3 25 under Code chapter 501A is subject to current Code chapter
  3 26 504 (Code section 504.1701). The bill also makes the same
  3 27 change to another statute that allows a nonprofit corporation
  3 28 to acquire agricultural land for research or experimental
  3 29 purposes under two exceptions:  first, by a domestic nonprofit
  3 30 corporation for research or experimental purposes (Code section
  3 31 9H.4(1)(b)), and second, by a domestic or foreign nonprofit
  3 32 corporation when acting in association with a state university

  4  4 the same requirements as provided for a corporation organized
  4  5 under and therefor subject to Code chapter 490 (Code sections
  4  6 490.860 through 490.863), including a so=called "safe harbor"
  4  7 exception. The bill also allows a director of a corporation
  4  8 organized under and subject to Code chapter 491 to take
  4  9 advantage of another safe harbor known as the "business
  4 10 opportunity" exception according to the same requirements that
  4 11 apply to a director of a corporation organized and subject to

  4 18 owed to the nonprofit corporation, the plaintiff must establish
  4 19 that the director's liability is not precluded by the director
  4 20 having acted under the business opportunity exception if such
  4 21 a defense is raised ("interposed as a bar to the proceeding")
