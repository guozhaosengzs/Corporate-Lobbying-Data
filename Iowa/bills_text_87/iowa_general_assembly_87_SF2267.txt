  9 19    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.    This division of this
  9 20 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  9 21 enactment.
  9 22                           EXPLANATION
  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.
 12 25    Division II of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.
 12 25    Division II of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  9 19    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.    This division of this
  9 20 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  9 21 enactment.
  9 22                           EXPLANATION
  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.
 12 25    Division II of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  9 22                           EXPLANATION
  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.

  9 22                           EXPLANATION
  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.

  9 14 division of this Act filed on or after the effective date of
  9 15 this division of this Act, an exemption otherwise authorized
  9 16 under this chapter shall not be authorized for or approved by a
  9 17 city or county, as applicable, for property that is residential
  9 18 property or multiresidential property.
  9 19    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.    This division of this
  9 20 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  9 21 enactment.
  9 22                           EXPLANATION
  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.

  9 20 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon

  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence

 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.

 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.

  9 20 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  9 21 enactment.
  9 22                           EXPLANATION
  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.

  9 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.

 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the

 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of

 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within

  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved
 12 23 by a city or county, as applicable, for property that is
 12 24 residential property or multiresidential property.
 12 25    Division II of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  9 25    This bill relates to the operation and use of urban renewal
  9 26 areas and urban revitalization areas.
  9 27    Division I of the bill excludes the property taxes
  9 28 certified or imposed by a taxing entity or body other than the
  9 29 municipality that established the urban renewal area from the
  9 30 division of revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment
  9 31 financing). Under the bill, such excluded taxes are not
  9 32 divided and paid into the municipality's special fund for the
  9 33 payment of urban renewal indebtedness but instead are required
  9 34 to be levied, collected, and paid to the taxing entity or body
  9 35 in the same manner as all other property taxes.
 10  1 Division I of the bill also authorizes an affected taxing
 10  2 entity to voluntarily transfer to the municipality all or
 10  3 a portion of the property taxes that would otherwise have
 10  4 been deposited into the municipality's urban renewal special
 10  5 fund but for the exclusion in the bill.  However, amounts
 10  6 voluntarily transferred by a school district are not to be
 10  7 considered a reduction in the amount of foundation property
 10  8 tax received by the school district and do not result in an
 10  9 increase in the amount of school foundation aid received by the
 10 10 school district.
 10 11    Division I of the bill requires a municipality to include the
 10 12 amounts of voluntary transfers of property taxes as authorized
 10 13 in the bill in the municipality's annual report required under
 10 14 Code section 331.403 or Code section 384.22.
 10 15    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 10 16 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 10 17 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 10 18 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 10 19 under Code section 357H.9.
 10 20    Division I of the bill modifies the definitions of "slum
 10 21 area", "economic development area", and "blighted area" for
 10 22 purposes of urban renewal areas established on or after the
 10 23 effective date of Division I of the bill to specify that such
 10 24 areas do not include property assessed as residential property
 10 25 or multiresidential property.  The bill also modifies the
 10 26 criteria under which an urban renewal plan for an urban renewal
 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
 10 33 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years
 10 34 beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are levied against any
 10 35 of the following: (1) property located in an urban renewal
 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the
 11  5 ordinance providing for a division of revenue if the annexation
 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of
 11 22 Division II of the bill for revitalization areas in existence
 11 23 on the effective date of Division II of the bill, the property
 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within
 12 16 revitalization areas.  For revitalization areas established
 12 17 on or after the effective date of Division II of the bill and
 12 18 for first=year exemption applications for property located in
 12 19 a revitalization area in existence on the effective date of
 12 20 Division II of the bill filed on or after the effective date
 12 21 of Division II of the bill, an exemption otherwise authorized
 12 22 under Code chapter 404 shall not be authorized for or approved

 10 27 area established on or after the effective date of Division I
 10 28 of the bill may be approved to forbid that the area comprising
 10 29 the urban renewal area include real property assessed as
 10 30 residential property or multiresidential property, or include
 10 31 certain agricultural property pursuant to current law.
 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and

 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the

 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year

 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or

 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the

 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or

 10 32    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment and

 11  1 area for which the ordinance providing for a division of
 11  2 revenue takes effect on or after the effective date of Division
 11  3 I of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included
 11  4 in an urban renewal area after the effective date of the

 11  6 or inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of Division
 11  7 I of the bill.
 11  8    Code chapter 404 authorizes the governing body of a city to
 11  9 designate an area of the city or the governing body of a county
 11 10 to designate an area of the county outside the boundaries
 11 11 of a city as a revitalization area if the property within
 11 12 that area meets certain statutory conditions for development
 11 13 or redevelopment. Qualified real estate located within the
 11 14 boundaries of an urban revitalization area may be eligible
 11 15 for specified property tax exemptions for actual value added
 11 16 by improvements. Current law authorizes the property tax
 11 17 exemption to extend to all property tax levies imposed on
 11 18 qualified real estate regardless of taxing jurisdiction.
 11 19    For revitalization areas established on or after the
 11 20 effective date of Division II of the bill and for first=year
 11 21 exemption applications filed on or after the effective date of

 11 24 tax exemption afforded to qualified real estate only extends to
 11 25 those property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 11 26 designating county and identified by the city or county in the
 11 27 adopted plan. In order for qualified real estate to be exempt
 11 28 from a property tax levy imposed by a taxing jurisdiction other
 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the
 11 32 exemption is authorized.
 11 33    Division II of the bill also authorizes the designating
 11 34 city or designating county to, following designation of
 11 35 the revitalization area by ordinance, amend the list  of
 12  1 property tax levies imposed by the designating city or
 12  2 designating county from which qualified real estate is exempt.
 12  3 Additionally, the bill provides that at any time following
 12  4 designation of the revitalization area by ordinance, the
 12  5 governing body of any other taxing jurisdiction that has
 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
 12  8 for levies previously approved by resolution.  However, the
 12  9 removal of a levy from the designating city or county's list
 12 10 or withdrawal of authorization for a property tax levy only
 12 11 applies to first=year exemption applications filed on or after
 12 12 the effective date of the resolution amending the list or
 12 13 approving the withdrawal, as applicable.
 12 14    Division II of the bill also establishes limitations on
 12 15 exemptions for residential and multiresidential property within

 11 29 than the designating city or designating county, the governing
 11 30 body of each such taxing jurisdiction must first adopt a
 11 31 resolution identifying each property tax levy for which the

 12  6 authorized an exemption from one or more levies may extend the
 12  7 exemption to additional levies or may withdraw authorization
