  9 30                           EXPLANATION
  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of
  9 34 the five soil commissioners who govern each soil and water
  9 35 conservation district (district) and who are elected to serve
 10  1 four=year terms on a nonpartisan basis.  The bill also relates
 10  2 to the powers and duties of a number of other state and local
 10  3 entities, including county boards of supervisors (boards),
 10  4 county treasurers, the state soil conservation committee
 10  5 (committee), the soil conservation division of the department
 10  6 of agriculture and land stewardship (division), and the
 10  7 attorney general.
 10  8    ELECTION OF COMMISSIONERS.  The bill removes the prohibition
 10  9 against more than one commissioner residing in the same
 10 10 township, requiring only residence within the district to be
 10 11 eligible for election at large to the office of commissioner.
 10 12 Provisions relating to appointments for vacancies in the
 10 13 office of commissioner are changed to allow for appointments
 10 14 to be made by the remaining commissioners, not the state soil
 10 15 conservation committee. The bill specifies that the person
 10 16 appointed does not serve out the full remaining term, but
 10 17 only for the time until the next succeeding general election.
 10 18 Appointed commissioners are then able to stand for election if
 10 19 they so choose.
 10 20    COMMISSIONERS, BOARDS, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ====
 10 21 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
 10 22 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
 10 23 significant soil loss for land located within the district,
 10 24 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
 10 25 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
 10 26 soil loss limits which shall be not more than five tons per
 10 27 acre during any 12=month period.  The regulations establishing
 10 28 soil loss limits are no longer required to be approved by the
 10 29 committee.
 10 30    The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10 31 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10 32 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection,
 10 33 the commissioners must issue an administrative order against
 10 34 a person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds
 10 35 the soil loss limit for the land in question. The order must
 11  1 describe the commissioners' findings, be delivered to the
 11  2 person responsible for causing the soil loss, and establish a
 11  3 period for compliance with the order. Evidence of compliance
 11  4 with the order includes applying for public moneys, such as
 11  5 cost=share financing, in order to defray a portion of the costs
 11  6 associated with complying with the order.  The bill requires
 11  7 the commissioners to give preference to applications which seek
 11  8 to comply with an administrative order.
 11  9    After the compliance period expires, if work to comply
 11 10 with the order is not being performed, the commissioners must
 11 11 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 11 12 general or the board of supervisors in the county in which
 11 13 the land is located. A person whose land is damaged due to
 11 14 neighboring land's erosion may also petition the board of
 11 15 supervisors to enforce the order. If the board takes action
 11 16 to enforce compliance with the order, the board must notify
 11 17 the county treasurer of the costs associated with taking its
 11 18 action. The treasurer must enter an amount equal to the costs
 11 19 plus a 5 percent penalty on the tax books, which shall be
 11 20 collected as ordinary taxes and constitutes a lien against
 11 21 the property. However, the board of supervisors may instead
 11 22 refer the matter to the attorney general. The commissioners,
 11 23 or the board or attorney general acting under a referral, must
 11 24 petition the district court to enforce the order.
 11 25    COMMITTEE AND DIVISION ==== PRIORITIZING SOIL CONSERVATION
 11 26 EFFORTS AND WATER QUALITY INITIATIVES.  The committee and
 11 27 division are to establish policies that prioritize the
 11 28 allocation of moneys, personnel, and technical expertise
 11 29 to support soil conservation efforts (Code chapter 161A),
 11 30 and water quality initiatives as sponsored by a watershed
 11 31 management authority formed by two or more districts (Code
 11 32 section 466B.43). The highest priority is to be given to
 11 33 support efforts in high=priority watersheds identified by the
 11 34 water resources coordinating council (Code section 466B.3).
       LSB 1359YH (7) 87
       sr/sc
  9 21 section 161A.4 and the division shall establish policies that
  9 22 prioritize the allocation of moneys, personnel, and technical
  9 23 expertise necessary to administer this chapter and chapter 161A
  9 24 to support water quality initiatives sponsored by a watershed
  9 25 management authority created by two or more soil and water
  9 26 conservation districts under section 466B.22.  The highest
  9 27 priority shall be given to support initiatives carried out in
  9 28 high=priority watersheds identified by the water resources
  9 29 coordinating council pursuant to section 466B.3.
  9 30                           EXPLANATION
  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of
  9 34 the five soil commissioners who govern each soil and water
  9 35 conservation district (district) and who are elected to serve
 10  1 four=year terms on a nonpartisan basis.  The bill also relates
 10  2 to the powers and duties of a number of other state and local
 10  3 entities, including county boards of supervisors (boards),
 10  4 county treasurers, the state soil conservation committee
 10  5 (committee), the soil conservation division of the department
 10  6 of agriculture and land stewardship (division), and the
 10  7 attorney general.
 10  8    ELECTION OF COMMISSIONERS.  The bill removes the prohibition
 10  9 against more than one commissioner residing in the same
 10 10 township, requiring only residence within the district to be
 10 11 eligible for election at large to the office of commissioner.
 10 12 Provisions relating to appointments for vacancies in the
 10 13 office of commissioner are changed to allow for appointments
 10 14 to be made by the remaining commissioners, not the state soil
 10 15 conservation committee. The bill specifies that the person
 10 16 appointed does not serve out the full remaining term, but
 10 17 only for the time until the next succeeding general election.
 10 18 Appointed commissioners are then able to stand for election if
 10 19 they so choose.
 10 20    COMMISSIONERS, BOARDS, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ====
 10 21 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
 10 22 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
 10 23 significant soil loss for land located within the district,
 10 24 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
 10 25 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
 10 26 soil loss limits which shall be not more than five tons per
 10 27 acre during any 12=month period.  The regulations establishing
 10 28 soil loss limits are no longer required to be approved by the
 10 29 committee.
 10 30    The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10 31 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10 32 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection,
 10 33 the commissioners must issue an administrative order against
 10 34 a person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds
 10 35 the soil loss limit for the land in question. The order must
 11  1 describe the commissioners' findings, be delivered to the
 11  2 person responsible for causing the soil loss, and establish a
 11  3 period for compliance with the order. Evidence of compliance
 11  4 with the order includes applying for public moneys, such as
 11  5 cost=share financing, in order to defray a portion of the costs
 11  6 associated with complying with the order.  The bill requires
 11  7 the commissioners to give preference to applications which seek

 11  9    After the compliance period expires, if work to comply
 11 10 with the order is not being performed, the commissioners must
 11 11 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 11 12 general or the board of supervisors in the county in which
 11 13 the land is located. A person whose land is damaged due to
 11 14 neighboring land's erosion may also petition the board of
 11 15 supervisors to enforce the order. If the board takes action
 11 16 to enforce compliance with the order, the board must notify
 11 17 the county treasurer of the costs associated with taking its
 11 18 action. The treasurer must enter an amount equal to the costs
 11 19 plus a 5 percent penalty on the tax books, which shall be
 11 20 collected as ordinary taxes and constitutes a lien against
 11 21 the property. However, the board of supervisors may instead
 11 22 refer the matter to the attorney general. The commissioners,
 11 23 or the board or attorney general acting under a referral, must
 11 24 petition the district court to enforce the order.

  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of
  9 34 the five soil commissioners who govern each soil and water
  9 35 conservation district (district) and who are elected to serve
 10  1 four=year terms on a nonpartisan basis.  The bill also relates
 10  2 to the powers and duties of a number of other state and local
 10  3 entities, including county boards of supervisors (boards),
 10  4 county treasurers, the state soil conservation committee
 10  5 (committee), the soil conservation division of the department
 10  6 of agriculture and land stewardship (division), and the
 10  7 attorney general.
 10  8    ELECTION OF COMMISSIONERS.  The bill removes the prohibition
 10  9 against more than one commissioner residing in the same
 10 10 township, requiring only residence within the district to be
 10 11 eligible for election at large to the office of commissioner.
 10 12 Provisions relating to appointments for vacancies in the
 10 13 office of commissioner are changed to allow for appointments
 10 14 to be made by the remaining commissioners, not the state soil
 10 15 conservation committee. The bill specifies that the person
 10 16 appointed does not serve out the full remaining term, but
 10 17 only for the time until the next succeeding general election.
 10 18 Appointed commissioners are then able to stand for election if
 10 19 they so choose.
 10 20    COMMISSIONERS, BOARDS, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ====
 10 21 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
 10 22 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
 10 23 significant soil loss for land located within the district,
 10 24 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
 10 25 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
 10 26 soil loss limits which shall be not more than five tons per
 10 27 acre during any 12=month period.  The regulations establishing
 10 28 soil loss limits are no longer required to be approved by the
 10 29 committee.
 10 30    The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10 31 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10 32 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection,
 10 33 the commissioners must issue an administrative order against
 10 34 a person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds
 10 35 the soil loss limit for the land in question. The order must
 11  1 describe the commissioners' findings, be delivered to the
 11  2 person responsible for causing the soil loss, and establish a
 11  3 period for compliance with the order. Evidence of compliance
 11  4 with the order includes applying for public moneys, such as
 11  5 cost=share financing, in order to defray a portion of the costs
 11  6 associated with complying with the order.  The bill requires
 11  7 the commissioners to give preference to applications which seek
 11  8 to comply with an administrative order.
 11  9    After the compliance period expires, if work to comply
 11 10 with the order is not being performed, the commissioners must
 11 11 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 11 12 general or the board of supervisors in the county in which
 11 13 the land is located. A person whose land is damaged due to
 11 14 neighboring land's erosion may also petition the board of
 11 15 supervisors to enforce the order. If the board takes action
 11 16 to enforce compliance with the order, the board must notify
 11 17 the county treasurer of the costs associated with taking its
 11 18 action. The treasurer must enter an amount equal to the costs
 11 19 plus a 5 percent penalty on the tax books, which shall be
 11 20 collected as ordinary taxes and constitutes a lien against
 11 21 the property. However, the board of supervisors may instead
 11 22 refer the matter to the attorney general. The commissioners,
 11 23 or the board or attorney general acting under a referral, must
 11 24 petition the district court to enforce the order.

 11 29 to support soil conservation efforts (Code chapter 161A),
 11 30 and water quality initiatives as sponsored by a watershed
 11 31 management authority formed by two or more districts (Code

  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of
  9 34 the five soil commissioners who govern each soil and water
  9 35 conservation district (district) and who are elected to serve
 10  1 four=year terms on a nonpartisan basis.  The bill also relates
 10  2 to the powers and duties of a number of other state and local
 10  3 entities, including county boards of supervisors (boards),
 10  4 county treasurers, the state soil conservation committee
 10  5 (committee), the soil conservation division of the department
 10  6 of agriculture and land stewardship (division), and the
 10  7 attorney general.
 10  8    ELECTION OF COMMISSIONERS.  The bill removes the prohibition
 10  9 against more than one commissioner residing in the same
 10 10 township, requiring only residence within the district to be
 10 11 eligible for election at large to the office of commissioner.
 10 12 Provisions relating to appointments for vacancies in the
 10 13 office of commissioner are changed to allow for appointments
 10 14 to be made by the remaining commissioners, not the state soil
 10 15 conservation committee. The bill specifies that the person
 10 16 appointed does not serve out the full remaining term, but
 10 17 only for the time until the next succeeding general election.
 10 18 Appointed commissioners are then able to stand for election if
 10 19 they so choose.

 10 21 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
 10 22 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
 10 23 significant soil loss for land located within the district,
 10 24 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
 10 25 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
 10 26 soil loss limits which shall be not more than five tons per
 10 27 acre during any 12=month period.  The regulations establishing
 10 28 soil loss limits are no longer required to be approved by the
 10 29 committee.
 10 30    The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10 31 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10 32 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection,
 10 33 the commissioners must issue an administrative order against
 10 34 a person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds
 10 35 the soil loss limit for the land in question. The order must
 11  1 describe the commissioners' findings, be delivered to the
 11  2 person responsible for causing the soil loss, and establish a
 11  3 period for compliance with the order. Evidence of compliance
 11  4 with the order includes applying for public moneys, such as
 11  5 cost=share financing, in order to defray a portion of the costs
 11  6 associated with complying with the order.  The bill requires
 11  7 the commissioners to give preference to applications which seek
 11  8 to comply with an administrative order.
 11  9    After the compliance period expires, if work to comply
 11 10 with the order is not being performed, the commissioners must
 11 11 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 11 12 general or the board of supervisors in the county in which
 11 13 the land is located. A person whose land is damaged due to
 11 14 neighboring land's erosion may also petition the board of
 11 15 supervisors to enforce the order. If the board takes action
 11 16 to enforce compliance with the order, the board must notify
 11 17 the county treasurer of the costs associated with taking its
 11 18 action. The treasurer must enter an amount equal to the costs
 11 19 plus a 5 percent penalty on the tax books, which shall be
 11 20 collected as ordinary taxes and constitutes a lien against
 11 21 the property. However, the board of supervisors may instead
 11 22 refer the matter to the attorney general. The commissioners,
 11 23 or the board or attorney general acting under a referral, must
 11 24 petition the district court to enforce the order.

 10 30    The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10 31 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon

 10 33 the commissioners must issue an administrative order against
 10 34 a person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds
 10 35 the soil loss limit for the land in question. The order must
 11  1 describe the commissioners' findings, be delivered to the
 11  2 person responsible for causing the soil loss, and establish a
 11  3 period for compliance with the order. Evidence of compliance
 11  4 with the order includes applying for public moneys, such as

 11 11 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 11 12 general or the board of supervisors in the county in which
 11 13 the land is located. A person whose land is damaged due to
 11 14 neighboring land's erosion may also petition the board of
 11 15 supervisors to enforce the order. If the board takes action
 11 16 to enforce compliance with the order, the board must notify
 11 17 the county treasurer of the costs associated with taking its
 11 18 action. The treasurer must enter an amount equal to the costs
 11 19 plus a 5 percent penalty on the tax books, which shall be
 11 20 collected as ordinary taxes and constitutes a lien against
 11 21 the property. However, the board of supervisors may instead
 11 22 refer the matter to the attorney general. The commissioners,

 11 24 petition the district court to enforce the order.

 10 21 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
 10 22 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
 10 23 significant soil loss for land located within the district,
 10 24 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
 10 25 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
 10 26 soil loss limits which shall be not more than five tons per
 10 27 acre during any 12=month period.  The regulations establishing
 10 28 soil loss limits are no longer required to be approved by the
 10 29 committee.
 10 30    The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10 31 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10 32 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection,
 10 33 the commissioners must issue an administrative order against
 10 34 a person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds
 10 35 the soil loss limit for the land in question. The order must
 11  1 describe the commissioners' findings, be delivered to the
 11  2 person responsible for causing the soil loss, and establish a
 11  3 period for compliance with the order. Evidence of compliance
 11  4 with the order includes applying for public moneys, such as
 11  5 cost=share financing, in order to defray a portion of the costs
 11  6 associated with complying with the order.  The bill requires
 11  7 the commissioners to give preference to applications which seek
 11  8 to comply with an administrative order.
 11  9    After the compliance period expires, if work to comply
 11 10 with the order is not being performed, the commissioners must
 11 11 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 11 12 general or the board of supervisors in the county in which
 11 13 the land is located. A person whose land is damaged due to
 11 14 neighboring land's erosion may also petition the board of
 11 15 supervisors to enforce the order. If the board takes action
 11 16 to enforce compliance with the order, the board must notify
 11 17 the county treasurer of the costs associated with taking its
 11 18 action. The treasurer must enter an amount equal to the costs
 11 19 plus a 5 percent penalty on the tax books, which shall be
 11 20 collected as ordinary taxes and constitutes a lien against
 11 21 the property. However, the board of supervisors may instead
 11 22 refer the matter to the attorney general. The commissioners,
 11 23 or the board or attorney general acting under a referral, must
 11 24 petition the district court to enforce the order.
