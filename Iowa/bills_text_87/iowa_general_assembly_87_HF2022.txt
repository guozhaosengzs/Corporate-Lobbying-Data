  3  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  8    Under current law, a motor vehicle operated by a person while
  3  9 committing a second or subsequent operating=while=intoxicated
  3 10 (OWI) offense, or while that person's driver's license has been
  3 11 suspended, denied, revoked, or barred due to an OWI offense,
  3 12 may be immediately impounded or immobilized (Code section
  3 13 321J.4B).  An owner of a vehicle impounded or immobilized,
  3 14 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  3 15 operation of the vehicle by a person while that person's
  3 16 driver's license has been suspended, denied, revoked, or barred
  3 17 due to an OWI offense is guilty of a simple misdemeanor. A
  3 18 simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at least $65 but
  3 19 not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed 30 days.
  3 20 This bill alters the violation to a serious misdemeanor. A
  3 21 serious misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at least $315
  3 22 but not to exceed $1,875 and imprisonment not to exceed one
  3 23 year.
  3 24    Under current law, the period of impoundment or
  3 25 immobilization is the period of license revocation imposed upon
  3 26 the person convicted of the OWI offense or 180 days, whichever
  3 27 period is longer. The bill increases the period to the period
  3 28 of license revocation imposed upon the person convicted of the
  3 29 OWI offense or one year, whichever period is longer.
  3 30    Under current law, upon conviction of the defendant for a
  3 31 second or subsequent violation of operating a vehicle while
  3 32 that person's driver's license has been suspended, denied,
  3 33 revoked, or barred due to an OWI offense, a court is required
  3 34 to order, if the defendant is the owner of the vehicle used in
  3 35 the commission of the offense, that the vehicle be seized and
  4  1 forfeited to the state. The bill provides that the vehicle
  4  2 must also be seized and forfeited to the state upon conviction
  4  3 of the defendant for a first violation of operating a vehicle
  4  4 while that person's driver's license has been suspended,
  4  5 denied, revoked, or barred due to a second or subsequent OWI
  4  6 offense.
  4  7    In addition, the bill provides that if a person is convicted
  4  8 of a violation of Code section 321J.21 (driving while license
  4  9 suspended, denied, revoked, or barred due to an OWI offense),
  4 10 and if the person is the owner of the vehicle used in the
  4 11 commission of the offense, the vehicle must be immobilized
  4 12 through the installation of a device in the vehicle that
  4 13 completely prevents the vehicle from being operated in
  4 14 accordance with Code section 321J.4B.
  4 15    The bill also amends Code sections 321J.4B and 809A.3 for
  4 16 clarity and consistency.

  3 10 (OWI) offense, or while that person's driver's license has been
  3 11 suspended, denied, revoked, or barred due to an OWI offense,
  3 12 may be immediately impounded or immobilized (Code section
  3 13 321J.4B).  An owner of a vehicle impounded or immobilized,
  3 14 who knows of, should have known of, or gives consent to the
  3 15 operation of the vehicle by a person while that person's
  3 16 driver's license has been suspended, denied, revoked, or barred
  3 17 due to an OWI offense is guilty of a simple misdemeanor. A
  3 18 simple misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at least $65 but
  3 19 not to exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed 30 days.
  3 20 This bill alters the violation to a serious misdemeanor. A
  3 21 serious misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at least $315
  3 22 but not to exceed $1,875 and imprisonment not to exceed one
  3 23 year.
  3 24    Under current law, the period of impoundment or
  3 25 immobilization is the period of license revocation imposed upon
  3 26 the person convicted of the OWI offense or 180 days, whichever
  3 27 period is longer. The bill increases the period to the period
  3 28 of license revocation imposed upon the person convicted of the
  3 29 OWI offense or one year, whichever period is longer.
  3 30    Under current law, upon conviction of the defendant for a
  3 31 second or subsequent violation of operating a vehicle while
  3 32 that person's driver's license has been suspended, denied,
  3 33 revoked, or barred due to an OWI offense, a court is required
  3 34 to order, if the defendant is the owner of the vehicle used in
  3 35 the commission of the offense, that the vehicle be seized and
  4  1 forfeited to the state. The bill provides that the vehicle
