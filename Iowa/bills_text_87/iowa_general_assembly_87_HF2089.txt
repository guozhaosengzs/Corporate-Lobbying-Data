  2 24                           EXPLANATION
  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2 28 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of certain animals,
  2 29 by creating two new criminal offenses that relate to the
  2 30 mistreatment of a service dog, which is defined as a dog
  2 31 specially trained to assist a person with a disability (Code
  2 32 section 216C.11). The first new offense is interference with a
  2 33 service dog and the second new offense is cruelty to a service
  2 34 dog. Generally, the elements, punishments, and exceptions
  2 35 to each offense are similar to those in a current statute
  3  1 that prohibits the mistreatment of a police service dog (Code
  3  2 section 717B.9).
  3  3    INTERFERENCE WITH A SERVICE DOG.  The first offense
  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
  3  7 serious injury. That person is guilty of a serious
  3  8 misdemeanor.  A number of exceptions apply including actions
  3  9 by a peace officer, licensed veterinarian, or person acting
  3 10 in justified self=defense or the justified defense of another
  3 11 person.
  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed
  3 13 by a person who knowingly, and willfully or maliciously,
  3 14 mistreats or plans to mistreat the service dog by torture; the
  3 15 infliction of an injury in a manner that permanently disfigures
  3 16 or disables the service dog, or that causes the service dog's
  3 17 death; setting a trap or paying a bounty in order to inflict
  3 18 the same type of injury or death; or by administering a poison,
  3 19 noxious fumes, or noxious gas to the service dog. A person who
  3 20 commits the offense is guilty of a class "D" felony. The same
  3 21 exceptions that apply to interference with a service dog apply
  3 22 to this offense.
  3 23    BACKGROUND == CURRENT PROVISIONS.  Code chapter 717B
  3 24 prohibits the mistreatment of certain animals, including
  3 25 domesticated animals other than livestock (governed under Code
  3 26 chapter 717).  The Code chapter includes three offenses that
  3 27 cover the mistreatment of animals other than a police service
  3 28 dog including animal abuse that is punishable as an aggravated
  3 29 misdemeanor (Code section 717B.2); animal neglect that is
  3 30 punishable as a simple misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor if
  3 31 the mistreatment results in an animal's injury or death (Code
  3 32 section 717B.3); and animal torture that is punishable as an
  3 33 aggravated misdemeanor for the first conviction and as a class
  3 34 "D" felony for a subsequent conviction (Code section 717B.3A).
  3 35 In the case of animal torture, the person convicted must also
  4  1 undergo a psychological evaluation and treatment according to
  4  2 the terms of a court order.
  4  3    BACKGROUND == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The Code chapter's
  4  4 current offenses, and the bill's two new offenses, provide
  4  5 for punishments as follows:  (1) a simple misdemeanor is
  4  6 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
  4  7 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both, (2) a serious
  4  8 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
  4  9 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, (3)
  4 10 an aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
  4 11 no more than two years and a fine of at least $625 but not
  4 12 more than $6,250, and  (4) a class "D" felony is punishable by
  4 13 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
  4 14 $750 but not more than $7,500.

  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed

  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2 28 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of certain animals,
  2 29 by creating two new criminal offenses that relate to the
  2 30 mistreatment of a service dog, which is defined as a dog
  2 31 specially trained to assist a person with a disability (Code
  2 32 section 216C.11). The first new offense is interference with a
  2 33 service dog and the second new offense is cruelty to a service
  2 34 dog. Generally, the elements, punishments, and exceptions
  2 35 to each offense are similar to those in a current statute
  3  1 that prohibits the mistreatment of a police service dog (Code
  3  2 section 717B.9).
  3  3    INTERFERENCE WITH A SERVICE DOG.  The first offense
  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
  3  7 serious injury. That person is guilty of a serious
  3  8 misdemeanor.  A number of exceptions apply including actions
  3  9 by a peace officer, licensed veterinarian, or person acting
  3 10 in justified self=defense or the justified defense of another
  3 11 person.
  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed
  3 13 by a person who knowingly, and willfully or maliciously,
  3 14 mistreats or plans to mistreat the service dog by torture; the
  3 15 infliction of an injury in a manner that permanently disfigures
  3 16 or disables the service dog, or that causes the service dog's
  3 17 death; setting a trap or paying a bounty in order to inflict
  3 18 the same type of injury or death; or by administering a poison,
  3 19 noxious fumes, or noxious gas to the service dog. A person who
  3 20 commits the offense is guilty of a class "D" felony. The same
  3 21 exceptions that apply to interference with a service dog apply
  3 22 to this offense.
  3 23    BACKGROUND == CURRENT PROVISIONS.  Code chapter 717B
  3 24 prohibits the mistreatment of certain animals, including
  3 25 domesticated animals other than livestock (governed under Code
  3 26 chapter 717).  The Code chapter includes three offenses that
  3 27 cover the mistreatment of animals other than a police service
  3 28 dog including animal abuse that is punishable as an aggravated
  3 29 misdemeanor (Code section 717B.2); animal neglect that is
  3 30 punishable as a simple misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor if
  3 31 the mistreatment results in an animal's injury or death (Code
  3 32 section 717B.3); and animal torture that is punishable as an
  3 33 aggravated misdemeanor for the first conviction and as a class
  3 34 "D" felony for a subsequent conviction (Code section 717B.3A).
  3 35 In the case of animal torture, the person convicted must also

  2 20    b.  A veterinarian licensed in this state while practicing
  2 21 veterinary medicine as provided in chapter 169.

  2 24                           EXPLANATION
  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2 28 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of certain animals,
  2 29 by creating two new criminal offenses that relate to the
  2 30 mistreatment of a service dog, which is defined as a dog
  2 31 specially trained to assist a person with a disability (Code
  2 32 section 216C.11). The first new offense is interference with a
  2 33 service dog and the second new offense is cruelty to a service
  2 34 dog. Generally, the elements, punishments, and exceptions
  2 35 to each offense are similar to those in a current statute
  3  1 that prohibits the mistreatment of a police service dog (Code
  3  2 section 717B.9).
  3  3    INTERFERENCE WITH A SERVICE DOG.  The first offense
  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
  3  7 serious injury. That person is guilty of a serious
  3  8 misdemeanor.  A number of exceptions apply including actions
  3  9 by a peace officer, licensed veterinarian, or person acting
  3 10 in justified self=defense or the justified defense of another
  3 11 person.
  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed
  3 13 by a person who knowingly, and willfully or maliciously,
  3 14 mistreats or plans to mistreat the service dog by torture; the
  3 15 infliction of an injury in a manner that permanently disfigures
  3 16 or disables the service dog, or that causes the service dog's
  3 17 death; setting a trap or paying a bounty in order to inflict
  3 18 the same type of injury or death; or by administering a poison,
  3 19 noxious fumes, or noxious gas to the service dog. A person who
  3 20 commits the offense is guilty of a class "D" felony. The same
  3 21 exceptions that apply to interference with a service dog apply
  3 22 to this offense.
  3 23    BACKGROUND == CURRENT PROVISIONS.  Code chapter 717B
  3 24 prohibits the mistreatment of certain animals, including
  3 25 domesticated animals other than livestock (governed under Code
  3 26 chapter 717).  The Code chapter includes three offenses that
  3 27 cover the mistreatment of animals other than a police service
  3 28 dog including animal abuse that is punishable as an aggravated
  3 29 misdemeanor (Code section 717B.2); animal neglect that is
  3 30 punishable as a simple misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor if
  3 31 the mistreatment results in an animal's injury or death (Code
  3 32 section 717B.3); and animal torture that is punishable as an
  3 33 aggravated misdemeanor for the first conviction and as a class
  3 34 "D" felony for a subsequent conviction (Code section 717B.3A).
  3 35 In the case of animal torture, the person convicted must also
  4  1 undergo a psychological evaluation and treatment according to
  4  2 the terms of a court order.
  4  3    BACKGROUND == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The Code chapter's
  4  4 current offenses, and the bill's two new offenses, provide
  4  5 for punishments as follows:  (1) a simple misdemeanor is
  4  6 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
  4  7 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both, (2) a serious
  4  8 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
  4  9 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, (3)
  4 10 an aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
  4 11 no more than two years and a fine of at least $625 but not
  4 12 more than $6,250, and  (4) a class "D" felony is punishable by
  4 13 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
  4 14 $750 but not more than $7,500.

  2 16    2.  A person who commits cruelty to a service dog is guilty
  2 17 of a class "D" felony.
  2 18    3.  Subsections 1 and 2 do not apply to any of the following:

  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2 28 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of certain animals,
  2 29 by creating two new criminal offenses that relate to the
  2 30 mistreatment of a service dog, which is defined as a dog
  2 31 specially trained to assist a person with a disability (Code
  2 32 section 216C.11). The first new offense is interference with a
  2 33 service dog and the second new offense is cruelty to a service
  2 34 dog. Generally, the elements, punishments, and exceptions
  2 35 to each offense are similar to those in a current statute
  3  1 that prohibits the mistreatment of a police service dog (Code
  3  2 section 717B.9).
  3  3    INTERFERENCE WITH A SERVICE DOG.  The first offense
  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
  3  7 serious injury. That person is guilty of a serious
  3  8 misdemeanor.  A number of exceptions apply including actions
  3  9 by a peace officer, licensed veterinarian, or person acting
  3 10 in justified self=defense or the justified defense of another
  3 11 person.
  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed
  3 13 by a person who knowingly, and willfully or maliciously,
  3 14 mistreats or plans to mistreat the service dog by torture; the
  3 15 infliction of an injury in a manner that permanently disfigures
  3 16 or disables the service dog, or that causes the service dog's
  3 17 death; setting a trap or paying a bounty in order to inflict
  3 18 the same type of injury or death; or by administering a poison,
  3 19 noxious fumes, or noxious gas to the service dog. A person who
  3 20 commits the offense is guilty of a class "D" felony. The same
  3 21 exceptions that apply to interference with a service dog apply
  3 22 to this offense.
  3 23    BACKGROUND == CURRENT PROVISIONS.  Code chapter 717B
  3 24 prohibits the mistreatment of certain animals, including
  3 25 domesticated animals other than livestock (governed under Code
  3 26 chapter 717).  The Code chapter includes three offenses that
  3 27 cover the mistreatment of animals other than a police service
  3 28 dog including animal abuse that is punishable as an aggravated
  3 29 misdemeanor (Code section 717B.2); animal neglect that is
  3 30 punishable as a simple misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor if
  3 31 the mistreatment results in an animal's injury or death (Code
  3 32 section 717B.3); and animal torture that is punishable as an
  3 33 aggravated misdemeanor for the first conviction and as a class
  3 34 "D" felony for a subsequent conviction (Code section 717B.3A).
  3 35 In the case of animal torture, the person convicted must also
  4  1 undergo a psychological evaluation and treatment according to
  4  2 the terms of a court order.
  4  3    BACKGROUND == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The Code chapter's
  4  4 current offenses, and the bill's two new offenses, provide
  4  5 for punishments as follows:  (1) a simple misdemeanor is
  4  6 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
  4  7 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both, (2) a serious
  4  8 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
  4  9 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875, (3)
  4 10 an aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
  4 11 no more than two years and a fine of at least $625 but not
  4 12 more than $6,250, and  (4) a class "D" felony is punishable by

  2 30 mistreatment of a service dog, which is defined as a dog
  2 31 specially trained to assist a person with a disability (Code
  2 32 section 216C.11). The first new offense is interference with a

  2 34 dog. Generally, the elements, punishments, and exceptions
  2 35 to each offense are similar to those in a current statute
  3  1 that prohibits the mistreatment of a police service dog (Code
  3  2 section 717B.9).

  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
  3  7 serious injury. That person is guilty of a serious

  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed
  3 13 by a person who knowingly, and willfully or maliciously,
  3 14 mistreats or plans to mistreat the service dog by torture; the
  3 15 infliction of an injury in a manner that permanently disfigures
  3 16 or disables the service dog, or that causes the service dog's
  3 17 death; setting a trap or paying a bounty in order to inflict
  3 18 the same type of injury or death; or by administering a poison,
  3 19 noxious fumes, or noxious gas to the service dog. A person who
  3 20 commits the offense is guilty of a class "D" felony. The same

  3 30 punishable as a simple misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor if
  3 31 the mistreatment results in an animal's injury or death (Code

  3 33 aggravated misdemeanor for the first conviction and as a class
  3 34 "D" felony for a subsequent conviction (Code section 717B.3A).

  2 30 mistreatment of a service dog, which is defined as a dog
  2 31 specially trained to assist a person with a disability (Code
  2 32 section 216C.11). The first new offense is interference with a

  2 34 dog. Generally, the elements, punishments, and exceptions
  2 35 to each offense are similar to those in a current statute
  3  1 that prohibits the mistreatment of a police service dog (Code
  3  2 section 717B.9).
  3  3    INTERFERENCE WITH A SERVICE DOG.  The first offense
  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
  3  7 serious injury. That person is guilty of a serious

  3  9 by a peace officer, licensed veterinarian, or person acting
  3 10 in justified self=defense or the justified defense of another
  3 11 person.
  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed
  3 13 by a person who knowingly, and willfully or maliciously,
  3 14 mistreats or plans to mistreat the service dog by torture; the
  3 15 infliction of an injury in a manner that permanently disfigures
  3 16 or disables the service dog, or that causes the service dog's
  3 17 death; setting a trap or paying a bounty in order to inflict
  3 18 the same type of injury or death; or by administering a poison,
  3 19 noxious fumes, or noxious gas to the service dog. A person who
  3 20 commits the offense is guilty of a class "D" felony. The same

  3 27 cover the mistreatment of animals other than a police service
  3 28 dog including animal abuse that is punishable as an aggravated
  3 29 misdemeanor (Code section 717B.2); animal neglect that is
  3 30 punishable as a simple misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor if
  3 31 the mistreatment results in an animal's injury or death (Code
  3 32 section 717B.3); and animal torture that is punishable as an
  3 33 aggravated misdemeanor for the first conviction and as a class
  3 34 "D" felony for a subsequent conviction (Code section 717B.3A).
  3 35 In the case of animal torture, the person convicted must also

  2 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B, which provides
  2 28 for offenses relating to the mistreatment of certain animals,
  2 29 by creating two new criminal offenses that relate to the
  2 30 mistreatment of a service dog, which is defined as a dog
  2 31 specially trained to assist a person with a disability (Code
  2 32 section 216C.11). The first new offense is interference with a
  2 33 service dog and the second new offense is cruelty to a service
  2 34 dog. Generally, the elements, punishments, and exceptions
  2 35 to each offense are similar to those in a current statute
  3  1 that prohibits the mistreatment of a police service dog (Code
  3  2 section 717B.9).
  3  3    INTERFERENCE WITH A SERVICE DOG.  The first offense
  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
  3  7 serious injury. That person is guilty of a serious
  3  8 misdemeanor.  A number of exceptions apply including actions
  3  9 by a peace officer, licensed veterinarian, or person acting
  3 10 in justified self=defense or the justified defense of another
  3 11 person.
  3 12    CRUELTY TO A SERVICE DOG.  The second offense is committed
  3 13 by a person who knowingly, and willfully or maliciously,
  3 14 mistreats or plans to mistreat the service dog by torture; the
  3 15 infliction of an injury in a manner that permanently disfigures
  3 16 or disables the service dog, or that causes the service dog's
  3 17 death; setting a trap or paying a bounty in order to inflict
  3 18 the same type of injury or death; or by administering a poison,
  3 19 noxious fumes, or noxious gas to the service dog. A person who
  3 20 commits the offense is guilty of a class "D" felony. The same
  3 21 exceptions that apply to interference with a service dog apply
  3 22 to this offense.

  3 28 dog including animal abuse that is punishable as an aggravated
  3 29 misdemeanor (Code section 717B.2); animal neglect that is
  3 30 punishable as a simple misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor if
  3 31 the mistreatment results in an animal's injury or death (Code

  3  4 is committed by a person who knowingly, and willfully or
  3  5 maliciously, torments, strikes, or administers a nonpoisonous
  3  6 desensitizing substance to a service dog, without inflicting
