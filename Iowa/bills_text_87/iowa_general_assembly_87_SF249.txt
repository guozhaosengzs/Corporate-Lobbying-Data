  1 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 18    This bill relates to the smokefree air Act (Code chapter
  1 19 142D).
  1 20    The bill defines "vapor product" and adds to the definition
  1 21 of "smoking"  the use of a vapor product.

  1 25 excursion gambling boats, and racetracks).  The bill thereby
  1 26 subjects the entirety of these premises to the smoking
  1 27 prohibitions of the Act.
  1 28    Under Code chapter 142D, a person who smokes in an area where
  1 29 smoking is prohibited is subject to a civil penalty, which is a
  1 30 scheduled fine of $50.  A person who owns, operates, manages,
  1 31 or otherwise has custody or control of a public place, place
  1 32 of employment, area declared a nonsmoking place, or outdoor
  1 33 area regulated under Code chapter 142D and who fails to comply

  1 35 from an amount not to exceed $100 for a first violation to
  2  1 an amount not to exceed $500 for each additional violation
  2  2 in excess of a second violation in a year.  An employer who

  2  4 because the employee has made a complaint or has provided
  2  5 information or instituted a legal action under the Code chapter
  2  6 is subject to a civil penalty of not less than $2,000 and
  2  7 not more than $10,000 for each violation. In addition to

  2 12 or revocation of any permit or license issued to the person for
  2 13 the premises on which the violation occurred.  Violation of the

  2 15 by restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction,
  2 16 or other means provided by law, and the entity abating the
  2 17 public nuisance may take action to recover the costs of such
