  6  5    Sec. 8.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to charitable
  6  6 contributions to a certified regenerative medicine research
  6  7 institution made on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  8    Sec. 9.  TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE ISSUANCES.  Tax credit
  6  9 certificates available pursuant to the regenerative medicine
  6 10 research tax credit enacted in this Act shall not be issued by
  6 11 the department of revenue prior to July 1, 2019.
  6 12                           EXPLANATION
  6 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 15    This bill provides a tax credit against the individual or
  6 16 corporate income tax, the franchise tax, the insurance premiums
  6 17 tax, and the moneys and credits tax for 60 percent of a
  6 18 taxpayer's charitable contribution to a certified regenerative
  6 19 medicine research institution.
  6 20    Regenerative medicine research institutions must apply
  6 21 for and receive certification from the department of revenue
  6 22 (department) as described in the bill in order for charitable
  6 23 contributions to that institution to qualify for the tax
  6 24 credit.  To qualify for certification, a regenerative medicine
  6 25 research institution must be a tax=exempt organization under
  6 26 section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, must have
  6 27 its principal place of business in Iowa, must be directly
  6 28 engaged in research in this state solely using adult stem
  6 29 cells designed to develop novel clinical therapies for the
  6 30 functional repair and replacement of diseased tissues and
  6 31 organs, including cancer research, must spend at least 51
  6 32 percent of its annual budget on such research, and must agree
  6 33 to provide the department with certain information necessary
  6 34 to verify eligibility for the tax credits.  In addition, a
  6 35 regenerative medicine research institution must not be a
  7  1 conduit for research by another organization, and must not be
  7  2 a postsecondary institution or an entity receiving 25 percent
  7  3 or more of its annual budget from a postsecondary institution.
  7  4 Certification by the department is valid for one year, at which
  7  5 time regenerative medicine research institutions may apply for
  7  6 recertification.
  7  7    In order to claim the tax credit, a taxpayer must submit an
  7  8 application to the department as described in the bill on or
  7  9 after the date of the charitable contribution and receive a tax
  7 10 credit certificate.  No more than $10 million in tax credit
  7 11 certificates may be issued per fiscal year.  If applications
  7 12 for the tax credit exceed that amount in a fiscal year, the
  7 13 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  7 14 the applications were received and those applications will
  7 15 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  7 16    The bill provides procedures for when a tax credit shall be
  7 17 claimed by a taxpayer.  The tax credit is nonrefundable, but
  7 18 any amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be
  7 19 carried forward for up to four years.  The tax credit cannot
  7 20 be carried back to a prior tax year. The bill prohibits
  7 21 contributions receiving a tax credit from also being deducted
  7 22 as a charitable contribution.
  7 23    Finally, the bill includes legislative findings and a
  7 24 legislative purpose for the tax credit, and adds the tax
  7 25 credit to the list of tax expenditures to be reviewed by the
  7 26 legislative tax expenditure committee beginning in 2021.
  7 27    The bill applies to charitable contributions to a certified
  7 28 regenerative medicine research institution made on or after
  7 29 January 1, 2019.  However, the bill provides that tax credit
  7 30 certificates shall not be issued by the department prior to
  7 31 July 1, 2019.

  6 12                           EXPLANATION
  6 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 15    This bill provides a tax credit against the individual or
  6 16 corporate income tax, the franchise tax, the insurance premiums
  6 17 tax, and the moneys and credits tax for 60 percent of a
  6 18 taxpayer's charitable contribution to a certified regenerative
  6 19 medicine research institution.
  6 20    Regenerative medicine research institutions must apply
  6 21 for and receive certification from the department of revenue
  6 22 (department) as described in the bill in order for charitable
  6 23 contributions to that institution to qualify for the tax
  6 24 credit.  To qualify for certification, a regenerative medicine
  6 25 research institution must be a tax=exempt organization under
  6 26 section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, must have
  6 27 its principal place of business in Iowa, must be directly
  6 28 engaged in research in this state solely using adult stem
  6 29 cells designed to develop novel clinical therapies for the
  6 30 functional repair and replacement of diseased tissues and
  6 31 organs, including cancer research, must spend at least 51
  6 32 percent of its annual budget on such research, and must agree
  6 33 to provide the department with certain information necessary
  6 34 to verify eligibility for the tax credits.  In addition, a
  6 35 regenerative medicine research institution must not be a
  7  1 conduit for research by another organization, and must not be
  7  2 a postsecondary institution or an entity receiving 25 percent
  7  3 or more of its annual budget from a postsecondary institution.
  7  4 Certification by the department is valid for one year, at which
  7  5 time regenerative medicine research institutions may apply for
  7  6 recertification.
  7  7    In order to claim the tax credit, a taxpayer must submit an
  7  8 application to the department as described in the bill on or
  7  9 after the date of the charitable contribution and receive a tax
  7 10 credit certificate.  No more than $10 million in tax credit
  7 11 certificates may be issued per fiscal year.  If applications
  7 12 for the tax credit exceed that amount in a fiscal year, the
  7 13 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  7 14 the applications were received and those applications will
  7 15 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  7 16    The bill provides procedures for when a tax credit shall be
  7 17 claimed by a taxpayer.  The tax credit is nonrefundable, but
  7 18 any amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be
  7 19 carried forward for up to four years.  The tax credit cannot
  7 20 be carried back to a prior tax year. The bill prohibits
  7 21 contributions receiving a tax credit from also being deducted
  7 22 as a charitable contribution.
  7 23    Finally, the bill includes legislative findings and a
  7 24 legislative purpose for the tax credit, and adds the tax
  7 25 credit to the list of tax expenditures to be reviewed by the
  7 26 legislative tax expenditure committee beginning in 2021.
  7 27    The bill applies to charitable contributions to a certified

  6 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 15    This bill provides a tax credit against the individual or
  6 16 corporate income tax, the franchise tax, the insurance premiums
  6 17 tax, and the moneys and credits tax for 60 percent of a
  6 18 taxpayer's charitable contribution to a certified regenerative
  6 19 medicine research institution.
  6 20    Regenerative medicine research institutions must apply
  6 21 for and receive certification from the department of revenue
  6 22 (department) as described in the bill in order for charitable
  6 23 contributions to that institution to qualify for the tax
  6 24 credit.  To qualify for certification, a regenerative medicine
  6 25 research institution must be a tax=exempt organization under
  6 26 section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, must have
  6 27 its principal place of business in Iowa, must be directly
  6 28 engaged in research in this state solely using adult stem
  6 29 cells designed to develop novel clinical therapies for the
  6 30 functional repair and replacement of diseased tissues and
  6 31 organs, including cancer research, must spend at least 51
  6 32 percent of its annual budget on such research, and must agree
  6 33 to provide the department with certain information necessary
  6 34 to verify eligibility for the tax credits.  In addition, a
  6 35 regenerative medicine research institution must not be a
  7  1 conduit for research by another organization, and must not be
  7  2 a postsecondary institution or an entity receiving 25 percent
  7  3 or more of its annual budget from a postsecondary institution.
  7  4 Certification by the department is valid for one year, at which
  7  5 time regenerative medicine research institutions may apply for
  7  6 recertification.
  7  7    In order to claim the tax credit, a taxpayer must submit an
  7  8 application to the department as described in the bill on or
  7  9 after the date of the charitable contribution and receive a tax
  7 10 credit certificate.  No more than $10 million in tax credit
  7 11 certificates may be issued per fiscal year.  If applications
  7 12 for the tax credit exceed that amount in a fiscal year, the
  7 13 department is required to establish a wait list in the order
  7 14 the applications were received and those applications will
  7 15 receive priority for receiving tax credits in succeeding years.
  7 16    The bill provides procedures for when a tax credit shall be
  7 17 claimed by a taxpayer.  The tax credit is nonrefundable, but
  7 18 any amount in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability may be
  7 19 carried forward for up to four years.  The tax credit cannot
  7 20 be carried back to a prior tax year. The bill prohibits
  7 21 contributions receiving a tax credit from also being deducted
  7 22 as a charitable contribution.
  7 23    Finally, the bill includes legislative findings and a
  7 24 legislative purpose for the tax credit, and adds the tax
  7 25 credit to the list of tax expenditures to be reviewed by the
  7 26 legislative tax expenditure committee beginning in 2021.
  7 27    The bill applies to charitable contributions to a certified
  7 28 regenerative medicine research institution made on or after
  7 29 January 1, 2019.  However, the bill provides that tax credit
  7 30 certificates shall not be issued by the department prior to
