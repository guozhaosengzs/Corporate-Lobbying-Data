  2  2    Under current law, a person is prohibited from placing

  2  4 traveled portion of the roadway.  A person who violates this
  2  5 provision is subject to an injunction and guilty of creating a
  2  6 public nuisance, an aggravated misdemeanor.  Any obstruction
  2  7 is subject to removal.
  2  8    This bill prohibits a person from loitering, or placing or
  2  9 causing to be placed any obstruction, on the traveled portion
  2 10 of the right=of=way of a highway with a speed limit of 55 miles
  2 11 per hour or more with the intention of blocking the normal and

  2 13    A person who commits a first violation of the provisions
  2 14 of the bill is guilty of a serious misdemeanor punishable

  2 25 for creating a public nuisance under current law.  To the
  2 26 extent practicable, a court may order that the obstruction be
  2 27 abated or removed at the expense of the person.  The costs for
  2 28 abatement or removal of the obstruction may be entered as a
  2 29 personal judgment against the person or assessed against the
  2 30 property where the obstruction occurred, or both.
  2 31    The person is subject to prosecution by the county attorney
  2 32 in the county where the highway is located.  However, if the
  2 33 county attorney fails to initiate prosecution within 30 days,
  2 34 the attorney general may initiate and carry out the prosecution
  2 35 in cooperation, if possible, with the county attorney.
