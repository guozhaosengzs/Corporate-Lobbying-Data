                    SENATE RESOLUTION NO.                     SENATE RESOLUTION NO.                               BY  McCOY
  1  1 A Resolution urging the United States Congress to enact
  1  2    legislation that creates a roadmap to permanent
  1  3    status for temporary protected status recipients.
  1  4    WHEREAS, temporary protected status (TPS) is an
  1  5 immigration status permitted by section 244 of the
  1  6 federal Immigration and Nationality Act under which
  1  7 the federal government grants legal immigration status
  1  8 to people from certain countries afflicted by natural
  1  9 disasters, war, or other dangerous conditions; and
  1 10    WHEREAS, TPS currently protects approximately
  1 11 437,000 people in the United States from 10 countries
  1 12 who would otherwise be deported to areas suffering from
  1 13 disease, violence, starvation, the aftermath of natural
  1 14 disasters, and other life=threatening conditions; and
  1 15    WHEREAS, the largest groups of TPS recipients are
  1 16 from El Salvador with approximately 195,000 people,
  1 17 followed by Honduras with approximately 57,000 people,
  1 18 and Haiti with approximately 50,000 people; and
  1 19    WHEREAS, TPS recipients in Iowa and their families
  1 20 have been significant, contributing members of
  1 21 their communities and local economies for nearly 20
  1 22 years; and
  1 23    WHEREAS, ending TPS will devastate the United States
  1 24 economy, with estimates including a $3 billion cost
  1 25 to taxpayers for deporting TPS recipients from El
  1 26 Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti; over $45 billion in lost
  1 27 gross domestic product over a decade due to the lost
  1 28 productivity of these individuals; $6.9 billion in lost
  2  1 Social Security and Medicare contributions; and close
  2  2 to $1 billion in turnover costs incurred by employers
  2  3 for the wholesale termination of the employment of this
  2  4 population; and
  2  5    WHEREAS, terminating TPS before home countries
  2  6 are sufficiently recovered will have a profoundly
  2  7 destabilizing effect that will be felt in countries
  2  8 in need, by their neighbors, and at the United States
  2  9 borders, as more people flee their countries to save
  2 10 their lives and the lives of their families; and
  2 11    WHEREAS, the United States has a history of
  2 12 contributing to instability in countries covered by
  2 13 TPS; and
  2 14    WHEREAS, the federal Department of Homeland Security
  2 15 has already denied extension of TPS status to several
  2 16 countries, meaning that current recipients will lose
  2 17 their ability to work legally in the United States and
  2 18 will be at risk of being deported back to dangerous
  2 19 conditions in their home countries; NOW THEREFORE,
  2 20    BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That the Senate
  2 21 respectfully requests that the Iowa congressional
  2 22 delegation work to enact legislation that creates a
  2 23 roadmap to permanent status for TPS recipients and the
  2 24 millions of other immigrants in the United States; and
  2 25    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Secretary of the
  2 26 Senate shall distribute copies of this resolution to
  2 27 the members of the Iowa congressional delegation.
