EXPLANATION
24


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
25


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
26


Under
current
law,
the
department
of
transportation
(DOT)
27


is
authorized
to
designate
by
resolution
certain
of
its
28


employees
upon
each
of
whom
there
is
conferred
the
authority
29


of
a
peace
officer
to
enforce
all
laws
of
the
state
including
30


but
not
limited
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
DOT.
31


Employees
designated
as
peace
officers
in
this
manner
have
32


the
same
powers
conferred
by
law
on
peace
officers
for
the
33


enforcement
of
all
laws
of
this
state
and
the
apprehension
34

This
bill
amends
current
law
to
specify
that

S.F.
_____


employees
designated
as
peace
officers
in
this
manner
have
the
1


same
powers,
duties,
privileges,
and
immunities
conferred
by
2


law
on
peace
officers
relating
to
the
enforcement
of
all
laws
3


of
this
state
and
the
apprehension
of
violators.
4


Under
current
law,
such
employees
are
prohibited
from
5


exercising
the
general
powers
of
a
peace
officer
within
6


the
limits
of
any
city,
except
under
certain
circumstances.
7


However,
the
limitation
does
not
apply
when
a
public
offense
is
8


being
committed
in
the
employee’s
presence.
The
bill
strikes
9


these
provisions.
10


The
bill
provides
that
the
DOT
and
the
department
of
public
11


safety
are
required
to
coordinate
to
provide
effective
and
12


efficient
enforcement
of
all
laws
of
the
state,
including
any
13


related
regulatory
action.
14


In
2017,
the
general
assembly
amended
Code
section
321.477
15


to
specify
the
powers,
duties,
and
limitations
of
such
16


employees.
Under
the
terms
of
the
legislation,
the
amended
17


language
is
set
to
be
repealed
effective
July
1,
2018.
Because
18


the
bill
amends
language
enacted
in
2017,
the
bill
repeals
the
19


future
repeal
provision.
The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
