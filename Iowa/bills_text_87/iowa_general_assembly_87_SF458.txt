  3 24                           EXPLANATION
  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill directs the department of public health
  3 28 (department) to establish a psychiatric practitioner loan
  3 29 repayment program to be administered by the department to
  3 30 provide repayment of loans to psychiatric practitioners who
  3 31 comply with the requirements of the program and are employed
  3 32 by a qualified provider.
  3 33    The bill defines "psychiatric practitioner" as a
  3 34 psychiatrist, psychiatric advanced registered nurse
  3 35 practitioner, or a physician assistant with a certificate
  4  1 of added qualifications in mental health or psychiatry or
  4  2 practicing under the supervision of a psychiatrist; and
  4  3 "qualified provider" as a community mental health center, a
  4  4 provider designated to serve as the community mental health
  4  5 center by the county in which the provider is located, or
  4  6 a 501(c)(3) nonprofit mental health provider that serves
  4  7 patients, of  whom  at least 40 percent are Medicaid program
  4  8 recipients that is located in an area that is not a federally
  4  9 designated health professional shortage area.
  4 10    The bill requires an applicant to complete and file an
  4 11 application, including any information required by the
  4 12 department, and complete and return on a form approved by
  4 13 the department,  an affidavit of practice verifying that the
  4 14 applicant is a psychiatric practitioner employed by a qualified
  4 15 provider.
  4 16    The program agreement is to provide that in order to
  4 17 receive loan repayment, the individual shall agree to engage
  4 18 in practice as a psychiatric practitioner with a qualified
  4 19 provider for a period of at least four consecutive years.
  4 20    A psychiatric practitioner is eligible for loan repayments
  4 21 for not more than four consecutive years.  The annual amount
  4 22 of the loan repayment awarded shall be based on the amount of
  4 23 the psychiatric practitioner's outstanding loans and shall not
  4 24 exceed $25,000 for each completed full=time work year which
  4 25 commences upon employment with a qualified provider.  For
  4 26 psychiatric practitioners who work less than full=time, the
  4 27 loan repayment shall not exceed an amount that is prorated
  4 28 according to the number of hours worked.
  4 29    A psychiatric practitioner receiving loan repayment shall
  4 30 file an initial application and shall submit information,
  4 31 annually, as required by the department on the basis of which
  4 32 the applicant's continued eligibility for the loan repayment
  4 33 program will be evaluated and determined.
  4 34    The bill provides that moneys appropriated for the program
  4 35 shall be deposited in the health care workforce shortage fund
  5  1 and are appropriated to the department specifically to be used
  5  2 for the purposes of the program.
  5  3    The bill requires the department to submit in a report to
  5  4 the general assembly by January 1, annually, the number of
  5  5 psychiatric practitioners who received loan repayments, the
  5  6 amount paid to each psychiatric practitioner, and any other
  5  7 information the department deems appropriate.
  5  8    The department is required to adopt rules to administer the
  5  9 bill.
