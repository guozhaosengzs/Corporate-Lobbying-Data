  2 12                           EXPLANATION
  2 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 15    This bill modifies provisions that require school districts
  2 16 to retain in the third grade certain students, and adds a
  2 17 provision to require school districts to offer, under certain
  2 18 conditions, an intensive summer reading program for students in
  2 19 kindergarten through grade two whose reading is deficient.
  2 20    Currently, beginning in the summer of 2018, if a student is
  2 21 not reading proficiently and is persistently at risk in reading
  2 22 at the end of grade three, the school district, unless it has
  2 23 obtained a waiver from the department of education, must notify
  2 24 the student's parent or guardian that the parent or guardian
  2 25 may enroll the student in an intensive summer reading program.
  2 26 The bill delays the requirement until the summer of 2019 and
  2 27 provides that notification must be in writing.
  2 28    The bill also delays to 2019 provisions relating to a
  2 29 requirement that school districts retain a student in grade
  2 30 three if the student is persistently at risk in reading, the
  2 31 student's parent or guardian did not enroll the student in an
  2 32 intensive summer reading program, and the student does not
  2 33 qualify for a good cause exemption.
  2 34    The bill requires school districts to provide intensive
  2 35 summer reading programs, beginning in the summer of 2019,
  3  1 for students who are enrolled in kindergarten through grade
  3  2 two, but only if the general assembly appropriates funds for
  3  3 the programs.  For any year in which the general assembly
  3  4 appropriates funds for such programs and the school district
  3  5 has not obtained a waiver from the department of education, the
  3  6 school district must notify the parent or guardian of a student
