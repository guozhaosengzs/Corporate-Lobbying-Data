  1 25    b.  Education savings grants shall be made available to
  1 26 requesting parents and guardians of an eligible pupil each
  1 27 school budget year for the duration of the education savings
  1 28 grant period and in the manner authorized under subsection
  1 29 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational

  2  4 forms developed by the department, indicating that the parent

  2 10 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
  2 11 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
  2 12 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil

  2 15    b.  An application from the parent or guardian of an
  2 16 eligible pupil shall be approved for the duration of the
  2 17 education savings grant period. Upon submission of a valid
  2 18 application from the parent or guardian of an eligible pupil,
  2 19 the department of education shall enter into a contract with
  2 20 the parent or guardian requiring provision and funding of the
  2 21 education savings grant for each school budget year of the
  2 22 education savings grant period for which the pupil remains
  2 23 eligible under the requirements of this section.  The education

  3  7    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
  3  8 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
  3  9 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's

  3 26 year.  The director of the department of management has all
  3 27 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,

  3 34    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
  3 35 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
  4  1 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
  4  2 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
  4  3 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
  4  4    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
  4  5 administer the program.
  4  6    e.  Adopt rules for the administration of the fund and
  4  7 accounts within the fund.
  4  8    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
  4  9 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
  4 10 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The amount
  4 11 of the pupil's education savings grant shall be deposited
  4 12 into the pupil's account on July 1, and such amount shall be
  4 13 immediately available for the payment of qualified educational
  4 14 expenses incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  4 15 during that fiscal year using the payment method authorized
  4 16 under subsection 4, paragraph "c".
  4 17    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
  4 18 instruction under chapter 299A that accepts payment from a

  4 21 any portion of such payment with the parent, guardian, or
  4 22 pupil.
  4 23    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
  4 24 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
  4 25 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
  4 26 educational expenses in future fiscal years during which the
  4 27 pupil participates in the program or for the payment of higher
  4 28 education costs as provided under subsection 8.
  4 29    6.  a.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
  4 30 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school,
  4 31 textbooks, fees or payments for educational therapies,
  4 32 including tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum
  4 33 fees and materials for a course of study for a specific subject
  4 34 matter or grade level, tuition or fees for nonpublic online
  4 35 education programs, education materials and services for pupils
  5  1 with disabilities, including the cost of paraprofessionals
  5  2 and assistants who are trained in accordance with state law,
  5  3 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
  5  4 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
  5  5 amount in any fiscal year, higher education costs, as defined
  5  6 in section 12D.1, excluding room and board expenses, and other
  5  7 expenses incurred by the parent or guardian that are directly
  5  8 related to the education of the pupil at a nonpublic school,
  5  9 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
  5 10 accrediting agency approved by the department of education, or
  5 11 directly related to providing competent private instruction
  5 12 for the pupil under chapter 299A.  The cost of one computer or
  5 13 other portable computing device shall be allowed as a qualified
  5 14 educational expense for a pupil if such a purchase has not been
  5 15 made using funds from that pupil's account in either of the two
  5 16 immediately preceding fiscal years.
  5 17    b.  "Qualified educational expenses" does not include
  5 18 transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food or
  5 19 refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing for
  5 20 the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials, including
  5 21 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
  5 22 supplies.
  5 23    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
  5 24 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
  5 25 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
  5 26 payment from an account within the education savings grant
  5 27 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
  5 28 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
  5 29 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
  5 30 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
  5 31 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
  5 32 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
  5 33 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
  5 34 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
  5 35 under this section is prohibited from participating in the
  6  1 education savings grant program in the future.
  6  2    8.  a.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the
  6  3 pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  6  4 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
  6  5 level of competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
  6  6 department of management shall maintain the account in the
  6  7 fund until the pupil is twenty=three years of age. Following
  6  8 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=three
  6  9 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
  6 10 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
  6 11 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
  6 12 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
  6 13 community college located in this state, or a private college
  6 14 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
  6 15 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
  6 16 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
  6 17 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil
  6 18 turns twenty=three years of age shall be transferred by the
  6 19 department of management for deposit in the general fund of the
  6 20 state.
  6 21    b.  Notwithstanding the age limitation in paragraph "a",
  6 22 if the pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's account
  6 23 in the education savings grant fund upon graduation from high
  6 24 school or completion of an equivalent level of competent
  6 25 private instruction under chapter 299A serves on federal active
  6 26 duty, other than training, and is discharged under honorable
  6 27 conditions, the limitation date otherwise applicable under
  6 28 paragraph "a" shall be extended by one year for each year of
  6 29 federal active duty service by the pupil, but not to a date
  6 30 after the pupil's twenty=seventh birthday.
  6 31    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
  6 32 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
  6 33 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
  6 34 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
  6 35 a nonpublic school or provider of competent private instruction
  7  1 under chapter 299A to modify its academic standards for
  7  2 admission or educational program in order to receive payment
  7  3 from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's account
  7  4 in the education savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or
  7  5 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
  7  6 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds
  7  7 from a pupil's account in the education savings grant fund is
  7  8 not an agent of this state or of a political subdivision of
  7  9 this state. Rules adopted by the department to implement this
  7 10 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
  7 11 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
  7 12 are invalid.
  7 13    Sec. 3.  Section 422.7, Code 2018, is amended by adding the
  7 14 following new subsection:
  7 15      1  9    1.  a.  For the school budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  1 10 and each succeeding school budget year, the following resident
  1 11 pupils who are attending a nonpublic school, as defined
  1 12 in section 285.16, or who are receiving competent private
  1 13 instruction under chapter 299A shall be eligible to receive an
  1 14 education savings grant in the manner provided in this section:
  1 15    (1)  A pupil eligible to enroll in kindergarten.
  1 16    (2)  A pupil eligible to enroll in grade one through grade
  1 17 twelve if the pupil has attended a public school for the
  1 18 equivalent of the two immediately preceding semesters for which
  1 19 the educational savings grant is requested and if the pupil is
  1 20 not otherwise ineligible under this section.
  1 21    (3)  A pupil who received an education savings grant for
  1 22 the immediately preceding school budget year, who is eligible
  1 23 to enroll in grade one through grade twelve, and who is not
  1 24 otherwise ineligible under this section.
  1 25    b.  Education savings grants shall be made available to
  1 26 requesting parents and guardians of an eligible pupil each

  1 29 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
  1 30 expenses as provided in this section.
  1 31    c.  For purposes of this subsection, "resident" means the
  1 32 same as defined in section 282.1.
  1 33    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
  1 34 which the education savings grant is first requested or the
  1 35 school year following expiration of a previous education
  2  1 savings grant period, the parent or guardian of the pupil

  2  4 forms developed by the department, indicating that the parent
  2  5 or guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school
  2  6 or place the pupil under competent private instruction as
  2  7 provided for in chapter 299A.
  2  8    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
  2  9 the department of education, the application shall require
  2 10 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
  2 11 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
  2 12 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil
  2 13 under competent private instruction for the following school
  2 14 year.
  2 15    b.  An application from the parent or guardian of an
  2 16 eligible pupil shall be approved for the duration of the
  2 17 education savings grant period. Upon submission of a valid
  2 18 application from the parent or guardian of an eligible pupil,
  2 19 the department of education shall enter into a contract with
  2 20 the parent or guardian requiring provision and funding of the
  2 21 education savings grant for each school budget year of the
  2 22 education savings grant period for which the pupil remains
  2 23 eligible under the requirements of this section.  The education
  2 24 savings grant period is five years or the number of years until
  2 25 completion of the school year during which the pupil graduates
  2 26 from high school or completes an equivalent level of competent
  2 27 private instruction under chapter 299A, whichever is less,
  2 28 provided that the parent or guardian may terminate the contract
  2 29 at any time.
  2 30    c.  By March 1 preceding each school year, the department
  2 31 of education shall notify the department of management of the
  2 32 number of pupils designated for the following school year
  2 33 to receive an education savings grant and the amount of the
  2 34 education savings grant for each pupil.  The department of
  2 35 education shall also notify the parent or guardian of such
  3  1 pupils who are approved to receive an education savings grant.
  3  2    3.  a.  The department of management shall assign each
  3  3 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
  3  4 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of the
  3  5 regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide average
  3  6 foundation property tax per pupil for the same school year.
  3  7    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following

  3 10 account in the education savings grant fund established under
  3 11 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
  3 12 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
  3 13 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
  3 14 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
  3 15 school year or in a future school year pursuant to subsection

  5 30 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
  5 31 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
  5 32 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
  5 33 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for

  6 25 private instruction under chapter 299A serves on federal active
  6 26 duty, other than training, and is discharged under honorable

  7  2 admission or educational program in order to receive payment
  7  3 from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's account

  7  5 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
  7  6 that accepts payment from a parent or guardian using funds
  7  7 from a pupil's account in the education savings grant fund is
  7  8 not an agent of this state or of a political subdivision of
  7  9 this state. Rules adopted by the department to implement this

  7 23    Sec. 5.  APPLICABILITY.  The following applies to tax years
  7 24 beginning on or after January 1, 2019:
  7 25    The section of this Act enacting section 422.7, subsection
  7 26 51.
  7 27                           EXPLANATION
  7 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 30    This bill establishes an education savings grant program
  7 31 for pupils attending a nonpublic school or receiving competent
  7 32 private instruction and establishes an education savings grant
  7 33 fund.
  7 34    For the school budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  7 35 and each succeeding school budget year, resident pupils
  8  1 who are attending a nonpublic school or who are receiving
  8  2 competent private instruction are eligible to receive an
  8  3 education savings grant if the pupil is eligible to enroll in
  8  4 kindergarten, is eligible to enroll in grade 1 through grade 12
  8  5 and has attended a public school for the equivalent of the two
  8  6 immediately preceding semesters, or if the pupil received an
  8  7 education savings grant for the immediately preceding school
  8  8 budget year.  By January 31 preceding the school year for which
  8  9 the education savings grant is first requested or the school
  8 10 year following expiration of a previous education savings grant
  8 11 period, the parent or guardian of the pupil requesting to
  8 12 receive an education savings grant must submit an application
  8 13 to the department of education indicating that the parent or
  8 14 guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school or
  8 15 place the pupil under competent private instruction.
  8 16    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding each school
  8 17 year, the department of education must notify the department
  8 18 of management of the number of pupils designated for the
  8 19 following school year to receive an education savings grant and
  8 20 the amount of the education savings grant for each pupil.  An
  8 21 application from the parent or guardian of an eligible pupil
  8 22 shall be approved for the duration of the education savings
  8 23 grant period and the department of education shall enter into a
  8 24 contract with the parent or guardian requiring provision and
  8 25 funding of the education savings grant for each school budget
  8 26 year of the education savings grant period for which the pupil
  8 27 remains eligible.  The education savings grant period is five
  8 28 years or the number of years until completion of the school
  8 29 year during which the pupil graduates from high school or
  8 30 completes an equivalent level of competent private instruction,
  8 31 whichever is less, provided that the parent or guardian may
  8 32 terminate the contract at any time.
  8 33    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to the
  8 34 difference between 87.5 percent of the regular program state
  8 35 cost per pupil and the statewide average foundation property
  9  1 tax per pupil in the same school year.
  9  2    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in
  9  3 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  9  4 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  9  5 of management for the purpose of providing education savings
  9  6 grants.  For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2019, and each
  9  7 succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general
  9  8 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit
  9  9 in the fund the amount necessary to pay all education savings
  9 10 grants approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved
  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's

  7 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 30    This bill establishes an education savings grant program
  7 31 for pupils attending a nonpublic school or receiving competent
  7 32 private instruction and establishes an education savings grant
  7 33 fund.
  7 34    For the school budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  7 35 and each succeeding school budget year, resident pupils
  8  1 who are attending a nonpublic school or who are receiving
  8  2 competent private instruction are eligible to receive an
  8  3 education savings grant if the pupil is eligible to enroll in
  8  4 kindergarten, is eligible to enroll in grade 1 through grade 12
  8  5 and has attended a public school for the equivalent of the two
  8  6 immediately preceding semesters, or if the pupil received an
  8  7 education savings grant for the immediately preceding school
  8  8 budget year.  By January 31 preceding the school year for which
  8  9 the education savings grant is first requested or the school
  8 10 year following expiration of a previous education savings grant
  8 11 period, the parent or guardian of the pupil requesting to
  8 12 receive an education savings grant must submit an application
  8 13 to the department of education indicating that the parent or
  8 14 guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school or
  8 15 place the pupil under competent private instruction.
  8 16    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding each school
  8 17 year, the department of education must notify the department
  8 18 of management of the number of pupils designated for the
  8 19 following school year to receive an education savings grant and
  8 20 the amount of the education savings grant for each pupil.  An
  8 21 application from the parent or guardian of an eligible pupil
  8 22 shall be approved for the duration of the education savings
  8 23 grant period and the department of education shall enter into a
  8 24 contract with the parent or guardian requiring provision and
  8 25 funding of the education savings grant for each school budget
  8 26 year of the education savings grant period for which the pupil
  8 27 remains eligible.  The education savings grant period is five
  8 28 years or the number of years until completion of the school
  8 29 year during which the pupil graduates from high school or
  8 30 completes an equivalent level of competent private instruction,
  8 31 whichever is less, provided that the parent or guardian may
  8 32 terminate the contract at any time.
  8 33    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to the
  8 34 difference between 87.5 percent of the regular program state
  8 35 cost per pupil and the statewide average foundation property
  9  1 tax per pupil in the same school year.
  9  2    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in
  9  3 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  9  4 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  9  5 of management for the purpose of providing education savings
  9  6 grants.  For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2019, and each
  9  7 succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general
  9  8 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit
  9  9 in the fund the amount necessary to pay all education savings
  9 10 grants approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved
  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  9 26 account within the fund.
  9 27    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  9 28 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  9 29 pupil's account in the education savings grant fund for the
  9 30 payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9 31 years during which the pupil participates in the program or for
  9 32 higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  9 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 10  2 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
 10  3 account in the fund until the pupil reaches an age specified in
 10  4 the bill.  Until the pupil reaches the age limitation, moneys
 10  5 in the pupil's account may be used by the pupil for higher
 10  6 education costs, as defined in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a
 10  7 pupil's account when the pupil reaches the age limitation are
 10  8 transferred by the department of management for deposit in the
 10  9 general fund of the state.
 10 10    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10 11 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
 10 12 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
 10 13 in the education savings grant fund without being legally
 10 14 entitled to do so is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is
 10 15 subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows the department
 10 16 of management to initiate legal proceedings to recover grants

  7 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 30    This bill establishes an education savings grant program
  7 31 for pupils attending a nonpublic school or receiving competent
  7 32 private instruction and establishes an education savings grant
  7 33 fund.
  7 34    For the school budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  7 35 and each succeeding school budget year, resident pupils
  8  1 who are attending a nonpublic school or who are receiving
  8  2 competent private instruction are eligible to receive an
  8  3 education savings grant if the pupil is eligible to enroll in
  8  4 kindergarten, is eligible to enroll in grade 1 through grade 12
  8  5 and has attended a public school for the equivalent of the two
  8  6 immediately preceding semesters, or if the pupil received an
  8  7 education savings grant for the immediately preceding school
  8  8 budget year.  By January 31 preceding the school year for which
  8  9 the education savings grant is first requested or the school
  8 10 year following expiration of a previous education savings grant
  8 11 period, the parent or guardian of the pupil requesting to
  8 12 receive an education savings grant must submit an application
  8 13 to the department of education indicating that the parent or
  8 14 guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school or
  8 15 place the pupil under competent private instruction.
  8 16    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding each school
  8 17 year, the department of education must notify the department
  8 18 of management of the number of pupils designated for the
  8 19 following school year to receive an education savings grant and
  8 20 the amount of the education savings grant for each pupil.  An
  8 21 application from the parent or guardian of an eligible pupil
  8 22 shall be approved for the duration of the education savings
  8 23 grant period and the department of education shall enter into a
  8 24 contract with the parent or guardian requiring provision and
  8 25 funding of the education savings grant for each school budget
  8 26 year of the education savings grant period for which the pupil
  8 27 remains eligible.  The education savings grant period is five
  8 28 years or the number of years until completion of the school
  8 29 year during which the pupil graduates from high school or
  8 30 completes an equivalent level of competent private instruction,
  8 31 whichever is less, provided that the parent or guardian may
  8 32 terminate the contract at any time.
  8 33    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to the
  8 34 difference between 87.5 percent of the regular program state
  8 35 cost per pupil and the statewide average foundation property
  9  1 tax per pupil in the same school year.
  9  2    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in

  9  7 succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general
  9  8 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit
  9  9 in the fund the amount necessary to pay all education savings
  9 10 grants approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved
  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  9 26 account within the fund.
  9 27    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  9 28 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  9 29 pupil's account in the education savings grant fund for the
  9 30 payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9 31 years during which the pupil participates in the program or for
  9 32 higher education costs as authorized in the bill.

  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 10  2 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the

 10  4 the bill.  Until the pupil reaches the age limitation, moneys
 10  5 in the pupil's account may be used by the pupil for higher

  8 23 grant period and the department of education shall enter into a
  8 24 contract with the parent or guardian requiring provision and
  8 25 funding of the education savings grant for each school budget
  8 26 year of the education savings grant period for which the pupil
  8 27 remains eligible.  The education savings grant period is five
  8 28 years or the number of years until completion of the school
  8 29 year during which the pupil graduates from high school or
  8 30 completes an equivalent level of competent private instruction,
  8 31 whichever is less, provided that the parent or guardian may

  9  6 grants.  For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2019, and each
  9  7 succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general
  9  8 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit
  9  9 in the fund the amount necessary to pay all education savings
  9 10 grants approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved
  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  9 26 account within the fund.
  9 27    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  9 28 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  9 29 pupil's account in the education savings grant fund for the
  9 30 payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9 31 years during which the pupil participates in the program or for
  9 32 higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  9 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 10  2 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
 10  3 account in the fund until the pupil reaches an age specified in
 10  4 the bill.  Until the pupil reaches the age limitation, moneys
 10  5 in the pupil's account may be used by the pupil for higher
 10  6 education costs, as defined in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a
 10  7 pupil's account when the pupil reaches the age limitation are
 10  8 transferred by the department of management for deposit in the
 10  9 general fund of the state.
 10 10    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10 11 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
 10 12 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account

  7 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 30    This bill establishes an education savings grant program
  7 31 for pupils attending a nonpublic school or receiving competent
  7 32 private instruction and establishes an education savings grant
  7 33 fund.
  7 34    For the school budget year beginning July 1, 2019,
  7 35 and each succeeding school budget year, resident pupils
  8  1 who are attending a nonpublic school or who are receiving
  8  2 competent private instruction are eligible to receive an
  8  3 education savings grant if the pupil is eligible to enroll in
  8  4 kindergarten, is eligible to enroll in grade 1 through grade 12
  8  5 and has attended a public school for the equivalent of the two
  8  6 immediately preceding semesters, or if the pupil received an
  8  7 education savings grant for the immediately preceding school
  8  8 budget year.  By January 31 preceding the school year for which
  8  9 the education savings grant is first requested or the school
  8 10 year following expiration of a previous education savings grant
  8 11 period, the parent or guardian of the pupil requesting to
  8 12 receive an education savings grant must submit an application
  8 13 to the department of education indicating that the parent or
  8 14 guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school or
  8 15 place the pupil under competent private instruction.
  8 16    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding each school
  8 17 year, the department of education must notify the department
  8 18 of management of the number of pupils designated for the
  8 19 following school year to receive an education savings grant and
  8 20 the amount of the education savings grant for each pupil.  An
  8 21 application from the parent or guardian of an eligible pupil
  8 22 shall be approved for the duration of the education savings
  8 23 grant period and the department of education shall enter into a
  8 24 contract with the parent or guardian requiring provision and
  8 25 funding of the education savings grant for each school budget
  8 26 year of the education savings grant period for which the pupil
  8 27 remains eligible.  The education savings grant period is five
  8 28 years or the number of years until completion of the school
  8 29 year during which the pupil graduates from high school or
  8 30 completes an equivalent level of competent private instruction,
  8 31 whichever is less, provided that the parent or guardian may
  8 32 terminate the contract at any time.
  8 33    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to the
  8 34 difference between 87.5 percent of the regular program state
  8 35 cost per pupil and the statewide average foundation property
  9  1 tax per pupil in the same school year.
  9  2    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in

  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's

  9 29 pupil's account in the education savings grant fund for the
  9 30 payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9 31 years during which the pupil participates in the program or for
  9 32 higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  9 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 10  2 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the

  8 35 cost per pupil and the statewide average foundation property
  9  1 tax per pupil in the same school year.
  9  2    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in
  9  3 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  9  4 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  9  5 of management for the purpose of providing education savings
  9  6 grants.  For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2019, and each
  9  7 succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general
  9  8 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit
  9  9 in the fund the amount necessary to pay all education savings
  9 10 grants approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved
  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  9 26 account within the fund.
  9 27    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  9 28 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  9 29 pupil's account in the education savings grant fund for the
  9 30 payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9 31 years during which the pupil participates in the program or for
  9 32 higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  9 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 10  2 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
 10  3 account in the fund until the pupil reaches an age specified in
 10  4 the bill.  Until the pupil reaches the age limitation, moneys
 10  5 in the pupil's account may be used by the pupil for higher
 10  6 education costs, as defined in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a
 10  7 pupil's account when the pupil reaches the age limitation are
 10  8 transferred by the department of management for deposit in the

  8 10 year following expiration of a previous education savings grant
  8 11 period, the parent or guardian of the pupil requesting to
  8 12 receive an education savings grant must submit an application

  8 24 contract with the parent or guardian requiring provision and
  8 25 funding of the education savings grant for each school budget
  8 26 year of the education savings grant period for which the pupil

  8 28 years or the number of years until completion of the school
  8 29 year during which the pupil graduates from high school or

  8 35 cost per pupil and the statewide average foundation property
  9  1 tax per pupil in the same school year.
  9  2    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in
  9  3 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  9  4 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  9  5 of management for the purpose of providing education savings
  9  6 grants.  For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2019, and each
  9  7 succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general
  9  8 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit
  9  9 in the fund the amount necessary to pay all education savings
  9 10 grants approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved
  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  9 26 account within the fund.
  9 27    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  9 28 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  9 29 pupil's account in the education savings grant fund for the
  9 30 payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9 31 years during which the pupil participates in the program or for
  9 32 higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  9 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 10  2 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
 10  3 account in the fund until the pupil reaches an age specified in
 10  4 the bill.  Until the pupil reaches the age limitation, moneys
 10  5 in the pupil's account may be used by the pupil for higher
 10  6 education costs, as defined in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a
 10  7 pupil's account when the pupil reaches the age limitation are
 10  8 transferred by the department of management for deposit in the
 10  9 general fund of the state.
 10 10    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10 11 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
 10 12 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
 10 13 in the education savings grant fund without being legally
 10 14 entitled to do so is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is
 10 15 subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows the department
 10 16 of management to initiate legal proceedings to recover grants
 10 17 and amounts improperly awarded or paid.
 10 18    The bill provides that an education savings grant received
 10 19 by a taxpayer is not taxable income for purposes of state
 10 20 individual income taxation. This provision of the bill applies
 10 21 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

  9  7 succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general
  9  8 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit
  9  9 in the fund the amount necessary to pay all education savings
  9 10 grants approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved
  9 11 for an education savings grant, the department of management
  9 12 must establish an account for that pupil in the education
  9 13 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
  9 14 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  9 15 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  9 16 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  9 17 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  9 18 during that fiscal year or in a future fiscal year as provided
  9 19 in the bill.
  9 20    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  9 21 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  9 22 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  9 23 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  9 24 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  9 25 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  9 26 account within the fund.
  9 27    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  9 28 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the

  9 30 payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  9 31 years during which the pupil participates in the program or for
  9 32 higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  9 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 10  2 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
 10  3 account in the fund until the pupil reaches an age specified in
 10  4 the bill.  Until the pupil reaches the age limitation, moneys
 10  5 in the pupil's account may be used by the pupil for higher
 10  6 education costs, as defined in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a
 10  7 pupil's account when the pupil reaches the age limitation are
 10  8 transferred by the department of management for deposit in the
 10  9 general fund of the state.
 10 10    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
 10 11 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
 10 12 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
 10 13 in the education savings grant fund without being legally
 10 14 entitled to do so is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is
 10 15 subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows the department
 10 16 of management to initiate legal proceedings to recover grants
 10 17 and amounts improperly awarded or paid.
 10 18    The bill provides that an education savings grant received
 10 19 by a taxpayer is not taxable income for purposes of state
 10 20 individual income taxation. This provision of the bill applies
 10 21 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

  9 34 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  9 35 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 10  1 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
