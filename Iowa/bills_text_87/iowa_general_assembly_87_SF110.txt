 97 23    Sec. 104.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
 97 24 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
 97 25 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
 97 26 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
 97 27 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
 97 28 for direct use.
 97 29                           EXPLANATION
 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at

 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs

 97 23    Sec. 104.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
 97 24 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
 97 25 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
 97 26 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
 97 27 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
 97 28 for direct use.
 97 29                           EXPLANATION
 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water

 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),

 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code

 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 97 24 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
 97 25 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section

 97 29                           EXPLANATION
 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 97 24 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land

 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 97 24 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land

 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 97 24 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
 97 25 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
 97 26 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
 97 27 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
 97 28 for direct use.
 97 29                           EXPLANATION
 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.

 97 24 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
 97 25 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section

 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs

 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the

 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at

 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a

 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum

 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water

 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's

 97 29                           EXPLANATION
 97 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 97 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 97 32    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
 97 33 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
 97 34 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
 97 35 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
 98  1 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
 98  2 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
 98  3 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
 98  4 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
 98  5 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
 98  6 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
 98  7 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
 98  8 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
 98  9 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
 98 10 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
 98 11 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
 98 12 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization to
 98 13 establish a separate state assessment for water quality and
 98 14 soil conservation, if approved by a majority of its members at
 98 15 a referendum.  The bill also requires commodity organizations
 98 16 to conduct a special referendum to increase the rate of the
 98 17 assessment for water quality and soil conservation to equal
 98 18 any increase in the assessment for direct use or national
 98 19 assessment or both. Expenses associated with conducting a
 98 20 referendum would be paid from moneys deposited into the fund
 98 21 or by the executive council if moneys in the fund were not
 98 22 adequate to cover expenses. The referendum would be conducted
 98 23 in the same manner as an initial or special referendum
 98 24 conducted by the commodity organization under its specific
 98 25 Code chapter.  The special assessment could be continued or
 98 26 terminated in the same manner as the commodity organization's
 98 27 assessment for promotional activities.  The amount of the
 98 28 state assessment would be the same as the effective rate for
 98 29 the promotional assessment imposed under state or federal law.
 98 30 Moneys from the state assessment would be collected by the
 98 31 commodity organization and transferred to the division of soil
 98 32 conservation and water quality of the department of agriculture
 98 33 and land stewardship for purposes of supporting existing water
 98 34 quality programs and projects or soil conservation programs
 98 35 and projects. The bill authorizes the payment of refunds to
 99  1 producers who were eligible to receive refunds from their
 99  2 commodity organization and for the payment of expenses incurred
 99  3 by conducting a referendum to impose the state assessment.
