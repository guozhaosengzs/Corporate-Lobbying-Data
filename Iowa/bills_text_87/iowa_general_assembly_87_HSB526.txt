13


This

breach

15


The
bill
makes
several
changes
to

The
bill
expands
the

of
17

of
security”
to
include
the
reasonable
belief
of
18


unauthorized
acquisition
of
personal
information,
which
may
19


be
in
any
form,
including
electronic
or
paper
form.
However,
20


the
bill
removes
the
unauthorized
acquisition
of
personal
21


information
that
was
transferred
from
computerized
form
to
22


another
medium
from
the
definition
of
“breach
of

23


The
definition
of
“encryption”
is
modified
to
mean
the
use
of
24


an
128-bit
or
higher
algorithmic
process.
The
bill
modifies
25


the
definition

information,
health
insurance
information,


29


tax
information,
and
electronic
account
information
in
the


30


definition
of
“personal
information”.
31


Current
law
requires
a
person
who
owns
or
licenses
personal
32


information
that
is
subject
to
a
breach
of
security
to
give
33


notice
to
affected
consumers
in
the
most
expeditious
manner
34


possible
and
without

Current
law
provides
that
a
person
who
owns
or
licenses
3


personal
information
that
is
subject
to
breach
of
security
does
4


not
need
to
provide
notification
of
the
security
breach
to
5


affected
consumers
if
the
person
makes
a
written
determination
6


that
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood
of
financial
harm
to
7


affected
consumers.
The
bill
removes
the
term
“financial”,
8


allowing
a
person
to
refrain
from
providing
notification
if
9


the
person
makes
a
written
determination
that
there
is
no
10


reasonable
likelihood
of
harm
to
affected
consumers.
The
11


bill
also
requires
a
person
who
makes
such
a
determination
12


to
provide
this
written
determination
to
the

division
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
14


general
within
five
business
days
after
documenting
the
15


determination.
16


Current
law
requires
a
person
who
owns
or
licenses
personal
17

subject
to
a
breach
of
security
requiring
18


notification

the
breach
of
security
to
the
director
of
the
consumer
21


protection

22


The
bill
provides

written
notification
to
the
attorney
23


general
is
also
required
for
breaches
of
security
where
24


written

to
more

state
25


is
required
by
a

primary

regulator,
a
state

federal
law
that
gives
greater
protection
27
