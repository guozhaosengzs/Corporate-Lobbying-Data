  5 26 deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  5 27                           EXPLANATION
  5 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 30    This bill relates to controlled substances and precursor
  5 31 substances including provisions relating to the registration
  5 32 of persons who manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled
  5 33 substances, adding substances to the controlled substance
  5 34 schedules, and expanding the list of precursor substances for
  5 35 which reporting is required.
  6  1 DIVISION I.  The bill provides that a person who
  6  2 manufactures, distributes, or dispenses any controlled
  6  3 substance in this state or who proposes to engage in such
  6  4 activities in this state (registrant), obtain and maintain
  6  5 a registration issued by the board of pharmacy.  Currently,
  6  6 a registrant is required to obtain and maintain a biennial
  6  7 registration issued by the board of pharmacy.
  6  8    The bill requires a separate registration for each principal
  6  9 place of business of a registrant, when the registrant is
  6 10 conducting research with controlled substances.  Currently,
  6 11 a separate registration is required for each principal place
  6 12 of business where a registrant manufactures, distributes, or
  6 13 dispenses controlled substances.
  6 14    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to take disciplinary
  6 15 action against a registrant who manufactures, distributes,
  6 16 or dispenses any controlled substance within this state,
  6 17 without restricting, suspending, or revoking the registration.
  6 18 Currently, the board of pharmacy does not have the option to
  6 19 take disciplinary action against a registrant.
  6 20    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may discipline
  6 21 a registrant when the registrant has furnished false or
  6 22 fraudulent material information in any application under any
  6 23 Code chapter which applies to the registrant.  Currently, the
  6 24 board of pharmacy may take action against a registrant when
  6 25 the registrant has furnished false or fraudulent material
  6 26 information in any application under only Code chapter 124
  6 27 (controlled substances).
  6 28    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may limit the
  6 29 restriction of a registrant's registration or discipline of a
  6 30 registrant to a particular controlled substance when grounds
  6 31 exist for such restriction or discipline.  Currently, the
  6 32 board of pharmacy may impose such limits only when revoking or
  6 33 suspending a registrant's registration.
  6 34    Under the bill, if the board of pharmacy restricts a
  6 35 registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all
  7  1 controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at
  7  2 the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective
  7  3 date of the order may be place under seal.  Currently, if
  7  4 the board of pharmacy suspends or revokes a registrant's
  7  5 registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by
  7  6 the registrant at the time of the suspension or revocation or
  7  7 at the time of the effective date of the order may be placed
  7  8 under seal.
  7  9    The bill requires the board of pharmacy to notify the
  7 10 federal bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs, United States
  7 11 department of justice, or its successor agency, of all orders
  7 12 restricting a registrant's registration or disciplining a
  7 13 registrant.  Under current law, the board shall notify the
  7 14 federal agency when suspending or revoking the registration
  7 15 of a registrant including all forfeitures of controlled
  7 16 substances.
  7 17    If the board of pharmacy decides to suspend, restrict, or
  7 18 revoke a registrant's registration or discipline a registrant,
  7 19 the bill requires the board to serve upon the registrant a
  7 20 notice in accordance with Code section 17A.12.  Currently, the
  7 21 board of pharmacy institutes such proceedings by serving an
  7 22 order to show cause why the registrant should not be denied,
  7 23 revoked, or suspended, or why the registration should not be
  7 24 refused.
  7 25    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to suspend a
  7 26 registrant's registration while simultaneously pursuing an
  7 27 emergency adjudicative proceeding in accordance with Code
  7 28 section 17A.18A, if the board finds there is an immediate
  7 29 danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Currently,
  7 30 the board of pharmacy may suspend a registrant's registration
  7 31 without an order to show cause, if the board finds there is an
  7 32 imminent danger to the public health or safety.
  7 33    DIVISION II.  The bill classifies nine substances as
  7 34 schedule I controlled substances and one substance as a
  7 35 schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling
  8  1 actions taken by the United States department of justice, drug
  8  2 enforcement administration.
  8  3    For the nine schedule I controlled substances added in Code
  8  4 section 124.204(9) under the bill, the penalties under Code
  8  5 section 124.401(1)(a),(b), and (c) range, depending upon the
  8  6 amount of the controlled substance involved, from a class "B"
  8  7 felony punishable by confinement for not more than 50 years
  8  8 and a fine of not more than $1 million, to a class "C" felony
  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code
  8 17 section 124.206, it is a class "C" felony pursuant to Code
  8 18 section 124.401(1)(c)(9) for any unauthorized person to violate
  8 19 a provision of Code section 124.401(1) involving a schedule II
  8 20 controlled substance. A class "C" felony for this particular
  8 21 offense is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years
  8 22 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $50,000. If a
  8 23 person unlawfully possesses a schedule II controlled substance
  8 24 in violation of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a
  8 25 serious misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor
  8 26 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  8 27 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 28    The bill also classifies a substance as a precursor
  8 29 substance for purposes of certain reporting requirements.  A
  8 30 "precursor substance" is defined in Code section 124B.1 to
  8 31 mean a substance which may be used as a precursor in the
  8 32 illegal production of a controlled substance.  A person who
  8 33 sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes a precursor substance
  8 34 with knowledge or the intent that the recipient will use the
  8 35 precursor substance to unlawfully manufacture a controlled
  9  1 substance commits a class "C" felony under Code section
  9  2 124B.9(1).  A person who receives a precursor substance with
  9  3 the intent that the substance be used unlawfully to manufacture
  9  4 a controlled substance commits a class "C" felony under
  9  5 Code section 124B.9(2).  A class "C" felony is punishable by
  9  6 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  9  7 $1,000 but not more than $10,000.

  6 18 Currently, the board of pharmacy does not have the option to
  6 19 take disciplinary action against a registrant.
  6 20    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may discipline
  6 21 a registrant when the registrant has furnished false or
  6 22 fraudulent material information in any application under any
  6 23 Code chapter which applies to the registrant.  Currently, the
  6 24 board of pharmacy may take action against a registrant when
  6 25 the registrant has furnished false or fraudulent material
  6 26 information in any application under only Code chapter 124
  6 27 (controlled substances).
  6 28    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may limit the
  6 29 restriction of a registrant's registration or discipline of a
  6 30 registrant to a particular controlled substance when grounds
  6 31 exist for such restriction or discipline.  Currently, the
  6 32 board of pharmacy may impose such limits only when revoking or
  6 33 suspending a registrant's registration.
  6 34    Under the bill, if the board of pharmacy restricts a
  6 35 registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all
  7  1 controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at
  7  2 the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective
  7  3 date of the order may be place under seal.  Currently, if

  8  3    For the nine schedule I controlled substances added in Code
  8  4 section 124.204(9) under the bill, the penalties under Code
  8  5 section 124.401(1)(a),(b), and (c) range, depending upon the
  8  6 amount of the controlled substance involved, from a class "B"
  8  7 felony punishable by confinement for not more than 50 years
  8  8 and a fine of not more than $1 million, to a class "C" felony
  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation

  6 34    Under the bill, if the board of pharmacy restricts a
  6 35 registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all
  7  1 controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at
  7  2 the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective
  7  3 date of the order may be place under seal.  Currently, if
  7  4 the board of pharmacy suspends or revokes a registrant's
  7  5 registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by
  7  6 the registrant at the time of the suspension or revocation or
  7  7 at the time of the effective date of the order may be placed
  7  8 under seal.
  7  9    The bill requires the board of pharmacy to notify the
  7 10 federal bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs, United States
  7 11 department of justice, or its successor agency, of all orders
  7 12 restricting a registrant's registration or disciplining a
  7 13 registrant.  Under current law, the board shall notify the
  7 14 federal agency when suspending or revoking the registration
  7 15 of a registrant including all forfeitures of controlled
  7 16 substances.
  7 17    If the board of pharmacy decides to suspend, restrict, or
  7 18 revoke a registrant's registration or discipline a registrant,
  7 19 the bill requires the board to serve upon the registrant a
  7 20 notice in accordance with Code section 17A.12.  Currently, the
  7 21 board of pharmacy institutes such proceedings by serving an
  7 22 order to show cause why the registrant should not be denied,
  7 23 revoked, or suspended, or why the registration should not be
  7 24 refused.
  7 25    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to suspend a
  7 26 registrant's registration while simultaneously pursuing an
  7 27 emergency adjudicative proceeding in accordance with Code
  7 28 section 17A.18A, if the board finds there is an immediate
  7 29 danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Currently,
  7 30 the board of pharmacy may suspend a registrant's registration
  7 31 without an order to show cause, if the board finds there is an
  7 32 imminent danger to the public health or safety.
  7 33    DIVISION II.  The bill classifies nine substances as
  7 34 schedule I controlled substances and one substance as a
  7 35 schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling
  8  1 actions taken by the United States department of justice, drug
  8  2 enforcement administration.
  8  3    For the nine schedule I controlled substances added in Code
  8  4 section 124.204(9) under the bill, the penalties under Code
  8  5 section 124.401(1)(a),(b), and (c) range, depending upon the
  8  6 amount of the controlled substance involved, from a class "B"
  8  7 felony punishable by confinement for not more than 50 years
  8  8 and a fine of not more than $1 million, to a class "C" felony
  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code
  8 17 section 124.206, it is a class "C" felony pursuant to Code
  8 18 section 124.401(1)(c)(9) for any unauthorized person to violate
  8 19 a provision of Code section 124.401(1) involving a schedule II
  8 20 controlled substance. A class "C" felony for this particular
  8 21 offense is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years
  8 22 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $50,000. If a
  8 23 person unlawfully possesses a schedule II controlled substance
  8 24 in violation of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a
  8 25 serious misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor
  8 26 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  8 27 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 28    The bill also classifies a substance as a precursor
  8 29 substance for purposes of certain reporting requirements.  A
  8 30 "precursor substance" is defined in Code section 124B.1 to
  8 31 mean a substance which may be used as a precursor in the
  8 32 illegal production of a controlled substance.  A person who
  8 33 sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes a precursor substance
  8 34 with knowledge or the intent that the recipient will use the
  8 35 precursor substance to unlawfully manufacture a controlled
  9  1 substance commits a class "C" felony under Code section
  9  2 124B.9(1).  A person who receives a precursor substance with
  9  3 the intent that the substance be used unlawfully to manufacture
  9  4 a controlled substance commits a class "C" felony under
  9  5 Code section 124B.9(2).  A class "C" felony is punishable by
  9  6 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  9  7 $1,000 but not more than $10,000.

  7 35 schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling
  8  1 actions taken by the United States department of justice, drug
  8  2 enforcement administration.
  8  3    For the nine schedule I controlled substances added in Code
  8  4 section 124.204(9) under the bill, the penalties under Code
  8  5 section 124.401(1)(a),(b), and (c) range, depending upon the
  8  6 amount of the controlled substance involved, from a class "B"
  8  7 felony punishable by confinement for not more than 50 years
  8  8 and a fine of not more than $1 million, to a class "C" felony
  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code
  8 17 section 124.206, it is a class "C" felony pursuant to Code
  8 18 section 124.401(1)(c)(9) for any unauthorized person to violate
  8 19 a provision of Code section 124.401(1) involving a schedule II
  8 20 controlled substance. A class "C" felony for this particular
  8 21 offense is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years
  8 22 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $50,000. If a
  8 23 person unlawfully possesses a schedule II controlled substance
  8 24 in violation of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a
  8 25 serious misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor
  8 26 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  8 27 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 28    The bill also classifies a substance as a precursor
  8 29 substance for purposes of certain reporting requirements.  A
  8 30 "precursor substance" is defined in Code section 124B.1 to
  8 31 mean a substance which may be used as a precursor in the
  8 32 illegal production of a controlled substance.  A person who
  8 33 sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes a precursor substance
  8 34 with knowledge or the intent that the recipient will use the
  8 35 precursor substance to unlawfully manufacture a controlled
  9  1 substance commits a class "C" felony under Code section
  9  2 124B.9(1).  A person who receives a precursor substance with
  9  3 the intent that the substance be used unlawfully to manufacture
  9  4 a controlled substance commits a class "C" felony under
  9  5 Code section 124B.9(2).  A class "C" felony is punishable by
  9  6 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  9  7 $1,000 but not more than $10,000.

  5 32 of persons who manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled
  5 33 substances, adding substances to the controlled substance
  5 34 schedules, and expanding the list of precursor substances for
  5 35 which reporting is required.
  6  1 DIVISION I.  The bill provides that a person who
  6  2 manufactures, distributes, or dispenses any controlled
  6  3 substance in this state or who proposes to engage in such
  6  4 activities in this state (registrant), obtain and maintain
  6  5 a registration issued by the board of pharmacy.  Currently,
  6  6 a registrant is required to obtain and maintain a biennial
  6  7 registration issued by the board of pharmacy.
  6  8    The bill requires a separate registration for each principal
  6  9 place of business of a registrant, when the registrant is
  6 10 conducting research with controlled substances.  Currently,
  6 11 a separate registration is required for each principal place
  6 12 of business where a registrant manufactures, distributes, or
  6 13 dispenses controlled substances.
  6 14    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to take disciplinary
  6 15 action against a registrant who manufactures, distributes,
  6 16 or dispenses any controlled substance within this state,
  6 17 without restricting, suspending, or revoking the registration.
  6 18 Currently, the board of pharmacy does not have the option to
  6 19 take disciplinary action against a registrant.
  6 20    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may discipline
  6 21 a registrant when the registrant has furnished false or
  6 22 fraudulent material information in any application under any
  6 23 Code chapter which applies to the registrant.  Currently, the
  6 24 board of pharmacy may take action against a registrant when
  6 25 the registrant has furnished false or fraudulent material
  6 26 information in any application under only Code chapter 124
  6 27 (controlled substances).
  6 28    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may limit the
  6 29 restriction of a registrant's registration or discipline of a
  6 30 registrant to a particular controlled substance when grounds
  6 31 exist for such restriction or discipline.  Currently, the
  6 32 board of pharmacy may impose such limits only when revoking or
  6 33 suspending a registrant's registration.
  6 34    Under the bill, if the board of pharmacy restricts a
  6 35 registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all
  7  1 controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at
  7  2 the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective
  7  3 date of the order may be place under seal.  Currently, if
  7  4 the board of pharmacy suspends or revokes a registrant's
  7  5 registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by
  7  6 the registrant at the time of the suspension or revocation or
  7  7 at the time of the effective date of the order may be placed
  7  8 under seal.
  7  9    The bill requires the board of pharmacy to notify the
  7 10 federal bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs, United States
  7 11 department of justice, or its successor agency, of all orders
  7 12 restricting a registrant's registration or disciplining a
  7 13 registrant.  Under current law, the board shall notify the
  7 14 federal agency when suspending or revoking the registration
  7 15 of a registrant including all forfeitures of controlled
  7 16 substances.
  7 17    If the board of pharmacy decides to suspend, restrict, or
  7 18 revoke a registrant's registration or discipline a registrant,
  7 19 the bill requires the board to serve upon the registrant a
  7 20 notice in accordance with Code section 17A.12.  Currently, the
  7 21 board of pharmacy institutes such proceedings by serving an
  7 22 order to show cause why the registrant should not be denied,
  7 23 revoked, or suspended, or why the registration should not be
  7 24 refused.
  7 25    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to suspend a
  7 26 registrant's registration while simultaneously pursuing an
  7 27 emergency adjudicative proceeding in accordance with Code
  7 28 section 17A.18A, if the board finds there is an immediate
  7 29 danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Currently,
  7 30 the board of pharmacy may suspend a registrant's registration
  7 31 without an order to show cause, if the board finds there is an
  7 32 imminent danger to the public health or safety.
  7 33    DIVISION II.  The bill classifies nine substances as
  7 34 schedule I controlled substances and one substance as a
  7 35 schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling
  8  1 actions taken by the United States department of justice, drug

  8  4 section 124.204(9) under the bill, the penalties under Code
  8  5 section 124.401(1)(a),(b), and (c) range, depending upon the
  8  6 amount of the controlled substance involved, from a class "B"
  8  7 felony punishable by confinement for not more than 50 years
  8  8 and a fine of not more than $1 million, to a class "C" felony
  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code
  8 17 section 124.206, it is a class "C" felony pursuant to Code
  8 18 section 124.401(1)(c)(9) for any unauthorized person to violate
  8 19 a provision of Code section 124.401(1) involving a schedule II

  8 21 offense is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years
  8 22 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $50,000. If a
  8 23 person unlawfully possesses a schedule II controlled substance
  8 24 in violation of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a
  8 25 serious misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor
  8 26 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  8 27 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 28    The bill also classifies a substance as a precursor
  8 29 substance for purposes of certain reporting requirements.  A
  8 30 "precursor substance" is defined in Code section 124B.1 to
  8 31 mean a substance which may be used as a precursor in the
  8 32 illegal production of a controlled substance.  A person who
  8 33 sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes a precursor substance
  8 34 with knowledge or the intent that the recipient will use the
  8 35 precursor substance to unlawfully manufacture a controlled
  9  1 substance commits a class "C" felony under Code section
  9  2 124B.9(1).  A person who receives a precursor substance with
  9  3 the intent that the substance be used unlawfully to manufacture
  9  4 a controlled substance commits a class "C" felony under
  9  5 Code section 124B.9(2).  A class "C" felony is punishable by

  5 33 substances, adding substances to the controlled substance
  5 34 schedules, and expanding the list of precursor substances for
  5 35 which reporting is required.
  6  1 DIVISION I.  The bill provides that a person who
  6  2 manufactures, distributes, or dispenses any controlled
  6  3 substance in this state or who proposes to engage in such
  6  4 activities in this state (registrant), obtain and maintain
  6  5 a registration issued by the board of pharmacy.  Currently,
  6  6 a registrant is required to obtain and maintain a biennial
  6  7 registration issued by the board of pharmacy.
  6  8    The bill requires a separate registration for each principal
  6  9 place of business of a registrant, when the registrant is
  6 10 conducting research with controlled substances.  Currently,
  6 11 a separate registration is required for each principal place
  6 12 of business where a registrant manufactures, distributes, or
  6 13 dispenses controlled substances.
  6 14    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to take disciplinary
  6 15 action against a registrant who manufactures, distributes,
  6 16 or dispenses any controlled substance within this state,
  6 17 without restricting, suspending, or revoking the registration.
  6 18 Currently, the board of pharmacy does not have the option to
  6 19 take disciplinary action against a registrant.
  6 20    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may discipline
  6 21 a registrant when the registrant has furnished false or
  6 22 fraudulent material information in any application under any
  6 23 Code chapter which applies to the registrant.  Currently, the
  6 24 board of pharmacy may take action against a registrant when
  6 25 the registrant has furnished false or fraudulent material
  6 26 information in any application under only Code chapter 124
  6 27 (controlled substances).
  6 28    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may limit the
  6 29 restriction of a registrant's registration or discipline of a
  6 30 registrant to a particular controlled substance when grounds
  6 31 exist for such restriction or discipline.  Currently, the
  6 32 board of pharmacy may impose such limits only when revoking or
  6 33 suspending a registrant's registration.
  6 34    Under the bill, if the board of pharmacy restricts a
  6 35 registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all
  7  1 controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at
  7  2 the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective
  7  3 date of the order may be place under seal.  Currently, if
  7  4 the board of pharmacy suspends or revokes a registrant's
  7  5 registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by
  7  6 the registrant at the time of the suspension or revocation or
  7  7 at the time of the effective date of the order may be placed
  7  8 under seal.
  7  9    The bill requires the board of pharmacy to notify the
  7 10 federal bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs, United States
  7 11 department of justice, or its successor agency, of all orders
  7 12 restricting a registrant's registration or disciplining a
  7 13 registrant.  Under current law, the board shall notify the
  7 14 federal agency when suspending or revoking the registration
  7 15 of a registrant including all forfeitures of controlled
  7 16 substances.
  7 17    If the board of pharmacy decides to suspend, restrict, or
  7 18 revoke a registrant's registration or discipline a registrant,
  7 19 the bill requires the board to serve upon the registrant a
  7 20 notice in accordance with Code section 17A.12.  Currently, the
  7 21 board of pharmacy institutes such proceedings by serving an
  7 22 order to show cause why the registrant should not be denied,
  7 23 revoked, or suspended, or why the registration should not be
  7 24 refused.
  7 25    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to suspend a
  7 26 registrant's registration while simultaneously pursuing an
  7 27 emergency adjudicative proceeding in accordance with Code
  7 28 section 17A.18A, if the board finds there is an immediate
  7 29 danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Currently,
  7 30 the board of pharmacy may suspend a registrant's registration
  7 31 without an order to show cause, if the board finds there is an
  7 32 imminent danger to the public health or safety.
  7 33    DIVISION II.  The bill classifies nine substances as
  7 34 schedule I controlled substances and one substance as a
  7 35 schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling
  8  1 actions taken by the United States department of justice, drug
  8  2 enforcement administration.
  8  3    For the nine schedule I controlled substances added in Code
  8  4 section 124.204(9) under the bill, the penalties under Code
  8  5 section 124.401(1)(a),(b), and (c) range, depending upon the
  8  6 amount of the controlled substance involved, from a class "B"
  8  7 felony punishable by confinement for not more than 50 years
  8  8 and a fine of not more than $1 million, to a class "C" felony
  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code
  8 17 section 124.206, it is a class "C" felony pursuant to Code
  8 18 section 124.401(1)(c)(9) for any unauthorized person to violate
  8 19 a provision of Code section 124.401(1) involving a schedule II
  8 20 controlled substance. A class "C" felony for this particular
  8 21 offense is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years
  8 22 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $50,000. If a
  8 23 person unlawfully possesses a schedule II controlled substance
  8 24 in violation of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a
  8 25 serious misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor
  8 26 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  8 27 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 28    The bill also classifies a substance as a precursor
  8 29 substance for purposes of certain reporting requirements.  A
  8 30 "precursor substance" is defined in Code section 124B.1 to
  8 31 mean a substance which may be used as a precursor in the
  8 32 illegal production of a controlled substance.  A person who
  8 33 sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes a precursor substance
  8 34 with knowledge or the intent that the recipient will use the
  8 35 precursor substance to unlawfully manufacture a controlled
  9  1 substance commits a class "C" felony under Code section
  9  2 124B.9(1).  A person who receives a precursor substance with
  9  3 the intent that the substance be used unlawfully to manufacture
  9  4 a controlled substance commits a class "C" felony under
  9  5 Code section 124B.9(2).  A class "C" felony is punishable by
  9  6 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  9  7 $1,000 but not more than $10,000.

  6 12 of business where a registrant manufactures, distributes, or
  6 13 dispenses controlled substances.
  6 14    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to take disciplinary
  6 15 action against a registrant who manufactures, distributes,
  6 16 or dispenses any controlled substance within this state,
  6 17 without restricting, suspending, or revoking the registration.
  6 18 Currently, the board of pharmacy does not have the option to
  6 19 take disciplinary action against a registrant.
  6 20    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may discipline
  6 21 a registrant when the registrant has furnished false or
  6 22 fraudulent material information in any application under any
  6 23 Code chapter which applies to the registrant.  Currently, the
  6 24 board of pharmacy may take action against a registrant when
  6 25 the registrant has furnished false or fraudulent material
  6 26 information in any application under only Code chapter 124
  6 27 (controlled substances).
  6 28    The bill provides that the board of pharmacy may limit the
  6 29 restriction of a registrant's registration or discipline of a
  6 30 registrant to a particular controlled substance when grounds
  6 31 exist for such restriction or discipline.  Currently, the
  6 32 board of pharmacy may impose such limits only when revoking or
  6 33 suspending a registrant's registration.
  6 34    Under the bill, if the board of pharmacy restricts a
  6 35 registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all
  7  1 controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at
  7  2 the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective
  7  3 date of the order may be place under seal.  Currently, if
  7  4 the board of pharmacy suspends or revokes a registrant's
  7  5 registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by
  7  6 the registrant at the time of the suspension or revocation or
  7  7 at the time of the effective date of the order may be placed

  7 27 emergency adjudicative proceeding in accordance with Code
  7 28 section 17A.18A, if the board finds there is an immediate
  7 29 danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Currently,
  7 30 the board of pharmacy may suspend a registrant's registration
  7 31 without an order to show cause, if the board finds there is an
  7 32 imminent danger to the public health or safety.
  7 33    DIVISION II.  The bill classifies nine substances as
  7 34 schedule I controlled substances and one substance as a
  7 35 schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling
  8  1 actions taken by the United States department of justice, drug
  8  2 enforcement administration.

  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code

  7 14 federal agency when suspending or revoking the registration
  7 15 of a registrant including all forfeitures of controlled
  7 16 substances.
  7 17    If the board of pharmacy decides to suspend, restrict, or
  7 18 revoke a registrant's registration or discipline a registrant,
  7 19 the bill requires the board to serve upon the registrant a
  7 20 notice in accordance with Code section 17A.12.  Currently, the
  7 21 board of pharmacy institutes such proceedings by serving an
  7 22 order to show cause why the registrant should not be denied,
  7 23 revoked, or suspended, or why the registration should not be
  7 24 refused.
  7 25    The bill permits the board of pharmacy to suspend a
  7 26 registrant's registration while simultaneously pursuing an
  7 27 emergency adjudicative proceeding in accordance with Code
  7 28 section 17A.18A, if the board finds there is an immediate
  7 29 danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Currently,
  7 30 the board of pharmacy may suspend a registrant's registration
  7 31 without an order to show cause, if the board finds there is an
  7 32 imminent danger to the public health or safety.
  7 33    DIVISION II.  The bill classifies nine substances as
  7 34 schedule I controlled substances and one substance as a
  7 35 schedule II controlled substance in conformance with scheduling
  8  1 actions taken by the United States department of justice, drug
  8  2 enforcement administration.
  8  3    For the nine schedule I controlled substances added in Code
  8  4 section 124.204(9) under the bill, the penalties under Code
  8  5 section 124.401(1)(a),(b), and (c) range, depending upon the
  8  6 amount of the controlled substance involved, from a class "B"
  8  7 felony punishable by confinement for not more than 50 years
  8  8 and a fine of not more than $1 million, to a class "C" felony
  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code
  8 17 section 124.206, it is a class "C" felony pursuant to Code
  8 18 section 124.401(1)(c)(9) for any unauthorized person to violate
  8 19 a provision of Code section 124.401(1) involving a schedule II
  8 20 controlled substance. A class "C" felony for this particular
  8 21 offense is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years
  8 22 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $50,000. If a
  8 23 person unlawfully possesses a schedule II controlled substance
  8 24 in violation of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a
  8 25 serious misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor
  8 26 is punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a
  8 27 fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 28    The bill also classifies a substance as a precursor
  8 29 substance for purposes of certain reporting requirements.  A
  8 30 "precursor substance" is defined in Code section 124B.1 to
  8 31 mean a substance which may be used as a precursor in the
  8 32 illegal production of a controlled substance.  A person who
  8 33 sells, transfers, or otherwise furnishes a precursor substance
  8 34 with knowledge or the intent that the recipient will use the
  8 35 precursor substance to unlawfully manufacture a controlled
  9  1 substance commits a class "C" felony under Code section
  9  2 124B.9(1).  A person who receives a precursor substance with
  9  3 the intent that the substance be used unlawfully to manufacture
  9  4 a controlled substance commits a class "C" felony under
  9  5 Code section 124B.9(2).  A class "C" felony is punishable by
  9  6 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  9  7 $1,000 but not more than $10,000.

  6  3 substance in this state or who proposes to engage in such
  6  4 activities in this state (registrant), obtain and maintain
  6  5 a registration issued by the board of pharmacy.  Currently,

  6 29 restriction of a registrant's registration or discipline of a
  6 30 registrant to a particular controlled substance when grounds
  6 31 exist for such restriction or discipline.  Currently, the
  6 32 board of pharmacy may impose such limits only when revoking or
  6 33 suspending a registrant's registration.
  6 34    Under the bill, if the board of pharmacy restricts a
  6 35 registrant's registration or disciplines a registrant, all
  7  1 controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at
  7  2 the time of the restriction or at the time of the effective
  7  3 date of the order may be place under seal.  Currently, if
  7  4 the board of pharmacy suspends or revokes a registrant's
  7  5 registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by
  7  6 the registrant at the time of the suspension or revocation or
  7  7 at the time of the effective date of the order may be placed

  7 27 emergency adjudicative proceeding in accordance with Code
  7 28 section 17A.18A, if the board finds there is an immediate
  7 29 danger to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Currently,
  7 30 the board of pharmacy may suspend a registrant's registration
  7 31 without an order to show cause, if the board finds there is an

  8  9 punishable by confinement of not more than 10 years and a fine
  8 10 of at least $1,000 and not more than $50,000.  If a person
  8 11 unlawfully possesses any such controlled substance in violation
  8 12 of Code section 124.401(5), the person commits a serious
  8 13 misdemeanor for a first offense. A serious misdemeanor is
  8 14 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
  8 15 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8 16    For the schedule II controlled substance added under Code
  8 17 section 124.206, it is a class "C" felony pursuant to Code
  8 18 section 124.401(1)(c)(9) for any unauthorized person to violate
  8 19 a provision of Code section 124.401(1) involving a schedule II
