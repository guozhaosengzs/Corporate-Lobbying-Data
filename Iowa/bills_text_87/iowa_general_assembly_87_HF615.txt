  7  9 agreement.
  7 10    The bill permits the director of revenue to require

  7 16 sales and use tax law are applicable to the administration of
  7 17 the money transfer service fee.
  7 18    Failure by a licensee to collect and remit money transfer
  7 19 service fees or to comply with any other provision of the bill
  7 20 shall subject the licensee to the enforcement provisions of
  7 21 article 7 of Code chapter 533C.  The bill requires the director
  7 22 and the department to cooperate with the superintendent in
  7 23 identifying violations of the bill and in discharging the

  8  5    The bill provides that all money transfer service fees
  8  6 collected under the bill shall be deposited in the financial
  8  7 crime and wire transmitter fund established by the bill.
  8  8    The money transfer service fee does not apply to numerous
  8  9 types of transactions including but not limited to a sale

  8 11 States, an internet or telephone transfer, the sale of a
  8 12 prepaid debit card or stored=value card, or a check cashing or

  8 20    The bill requires a licensee furnishing money transfer
  8 21 services to post a notice in the form and manner prescribed

  8 24 identification number, the customer shall be entitled to an
  8 25 individual income tax credit equal to the amount of money
  8 26 transfer service fees paid by the customer during the tax year.
  8 27    The bill also applies to authorized delegates of a licensee
  8 28 under Code chapter 533C.
  8 29    The bill provides an individual income tax credit equal to
  8 30 the amount of money transfer service fees paid by the taxpayer
  8 31 during the tax year. The bill provides that the credit shall
  8 32 not be allowed to an individual who does not include on the tax
  8 33 return for the taxable year the individual's valid taxpayer
  8 34 identification number and that of the individual's spouse if
  8 35 applicable. The bill provides that the credit is refundable
  9  1 and may be credited to the individual's tax liability for the
  9  2 following tax year. The provision enacting the tax credit
  9  3 applies retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years
  9  4 beginning on or after that date.
  9  5    The bill establishes a financial crime and wire transmitter
  9  6 fund in the office of the treasurer of state under the control
  9  7 of the department of public safety. Any moneys annually
  9  8 appropriated, granted, or credited to the fund, including any
  9  9 federal moneys, are appropriated to the department of public
  9 10 safety for the purpose of investigating indictable criminal
  9 11 offenses committed for financial gain. Interest and earnings
  9 12 on moneys deposited in the fund shall be credited to the fund
  9 13 and moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the fiscal year
  9 14 shall not revert.
  9 15    The bill requires the department of public safety, for
  9 16 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and for each fiscal
  9 17 year thereafter, to transfer from the fund to the general
  9 18 fund of the state, the lesser of the amount of money transfer
  9 19 service fees collected or an amount of money equal to the money
  9 20 transfer service tax credits claimed in that fiscal year, if
  9 21 any. The bill provides that the moneys transferred to the
  9 22 general fund of the state in accordance with the bill shall not
  9 23 be considered new revenues for purposes of the state general
  9 24 fund expenditure limitation under Code section 8.54 but instead
  9 25 as replacement of a like amount included in the expenditure
  9 26 limitation for the fiscal year in which the transfer is made.

  6 12                           EXPLANATION
  6 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 15    This bill relates to financial crime enforcement by
  6 16 assessing a drug paraphernalia surcharge and creating a money
  6 17 transfer service fee and related fund and income tax credit.
  6 18    DRUG PARAPHERNALIA SURCHARGE.  The bill provides that the
  6 19 clerk of the district court shall assess a drug paraphernalia
  6 20 surcharge of five dollars if an adjudication of guilt or
  6 21 a deferred judgment has been entered for possessing drug
  6 22 paraphernalia in violation of Code section 124.414 or a similar
  6 23 city or county ordinance.  The bill specifies that the clerk of
  6 24 the district court shall remit all moneys collected from the

  6 26 for deposit in the financial crime and wire transmitter fund

  6 28    MONEY TRANSFER SERVICE FEE AND RELATED FUND AND TAX CREDIT.
  6 29 The bill requires a licensee under Code chapter 533C, the
  6 30 uniform money services Act, to collect from customers a money
  6 31 transfer service fee equal to 1 percent of the amount of each

  6 34 including transmission within this country or to or from
  6 35 locations abroad by payment instrument, wire, facsimile, or
  7  1 electronic transfer, courier, or otherwise.
  7  2    The bill requires such licensees to pay such fees over to the
  7  3 department of revenue. The bill requires the department, in
  7  4 consultation with the superintendent of banking, to administer
  7  5 and enforce the money transfer service fee as nearly as
  7  6 possible in conjunction with the administration and enforcement
  7  7 of the state sales and use tax law, except that portion of
  7  8 the law which implements the streamlined sales and use tax
  7  9 agreement.
  7 10    The bill permits the director of revenue to require
  7 11 licensees to register with the department for purposes of
  7 12 the bill. The bill permits the director to require a permit
  7 13 applicable only to the bill for any licensee not collecting

  7 15 powers and requirements of the director to administer the state
  7 16 sales and use tax law are applicable to the administration of
  7 17 the money transfer service fee.
  7 18    Failure by a licensee to collect and remit money transfer
  7 19 service fees or to comply with any other provision of the bill
  7 20 shall subject the licensee to the enforcement provisions of
  7 21 article 7 of Code chapter 533C.  The bill requires the director
  7 22 and the department to cooperate with the superintendent in
  7 23 identifying violations of the bill and in discharging the
  7 24 superintendent's enforcement responsibilities under article 7
  7 25 of Code chapter 533C.
  7 26    Penalties provided for in article 7 of Code chapter 533C
  7 27 include suspension and revocation of a license under Code
  7 28 chapter 533C, civil penalties, and criminal penalties that

  7 35 is punishable by confinement for no more than two years and
  8  1 a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250. A simple
  8  2 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than 30
  8  3 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or by
  8  4 both.
  8  5    The bill provides that all money transfer service fees
  8  6 collected under the bill shall be deposited in the financial
  8  7 crime and wire transmitter fund established by the bill.
  8  8    The money transfer service fee does not apply to numerous
  8  9 types of transactions including but not limited to a sale
  8 10 between an individual and any business registered in the United
  8 11 States, an internet or telephone transfer, the sale of a
  8 12 prepaid debit card or stored=value card, or a check cashing or
  8 13 delayed deposit transaction.
  8 14    The money transfer service fee also does not apply to
  8 15 numerous types of entities including but not limited to the

  8 17 money transmission by the United States postal service, an
  8 18 operator of a credit or debit payment system, or a commodity
  8 19 or security trader.
  8 20    The bill requires a licensee furnishing money transfer
  8 21 services to post a notice in the form and manner prescribed
  8 22 by the superintendent that notifies customers that upon
  8 23 filing an individual income tax return with a valid taxpayer
  8 24 identification number, the customer shall be entitled to an
  8 25 individual income tax credit equal to the amount of money
  8 26 transfer service fees paid by the customer during the tax year.
  8 27    The bill also applies to authorized delegates of a licensee
  8 28 under Code chapter 533C.
  8 29    The bill provides an individual income tax credit equal to
  8 30 the amount of money transfer service fees paid by the taxpayer
  8 31 during the tax year. The bill provides that the credit shall
  8 32 not be allowed to an individual who does not include on the tax
  8 33 return for the taxable year the individual's valid taxpayer
  8 34 identification number and that of the individual's spouse if
  8 35 applicable. The bill provides that the credit is refundable
  9  1 and may be credited to the individual's tax liability for the
  9  2 following tax year. The provision enacting the tax credit
  9  3 applies retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years
  9  4 beginning on or after that date.
  9  5    The bill establishes a financial crime and wire transmitter
  9  6 fund in the office of the treasurer of state under the control
  9  7 of the department of public safety. Any moneys annually
  9  8 appropriated, granted, or credited to the fund, including any
  9  9 federal moneys, are appropriated to the department of public
  9 10 safety for the purpose of investigating indictable criminal
  9 11 offenses committed for financial gain. Interest and earnings
  9 12 on moneys deposited in the fund shall be credited to the fund
  9 13 and moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the fiscal year
  9 14 shall not revert.
  9 15    The bill requires the department of public safety, for
  9 16 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and for each fiscal
  9 17 year thereafter, to transfer from the fund to the general
  9 18 fund of the state, the lesser of the amount of money transfer
  9 19 service fees collected or an amount of money equal to the money
  9 20 transfer service tax credits claimed in that fiscal year, if
  9 21 any. The bill provides that the moneys transferred to the
  9 22 general fund of the state in accordance with the bill shall not
  9 23 be considered new revenues for purposes of the state general
  9 24 fund expenditure limitation under Code section 8.54 but instead
  9 25 as replacement of a like amount included in the expenditure
  9 26 limitation for the fiscal year in which the transfer is made.
