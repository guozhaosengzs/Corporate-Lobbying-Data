  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill relates to employers and individuals who perform
  4 35 labor and wage payment collection.
  5  1 Code section 91A.5 is amended to provide that the employer
  5  2 has the burden to establish that a deduction from employees'
  5  3 wages is lawful and that the employer must obtain written
  5  4 authorization for the deduction from the employee in advance.
  5  5    Code section 91A.6(1) is amended to remove the requirement
  5  6 that an employer be notified by the division of labor services
  5  7 of the department of workforce development before the employer
  5  8 is required to fulfill the requirements in subsection 1
  5  9 relating to employee wage and benefit information.  In new
  5 10 Code section 91A.6(1)(b), the employer is required to notify
  5 11 employees in writing whose wages are determined based on a
  5 12 task, piece, mile, or load basis about the method used to
  5 13 calculate wages and when wages are earned.  Code section
  5 14 91A.6(1)(e) is amended to establish a rebuttable presumption
  5 15 that an employer did not pay the minimum wage if the employer
  5 16 does not maintain proper payroll records.

  5 18 compliance procedures, is stricken.
  5 19    Code section 91A.6(4) is amended so that the employer
  5 20 must send to each employee by mail, or at the place of
  5 21 business during the employee's working hours a statement of
  5 22 the employee's earnings, deductions made, and as applicable
  5 23 the following:  for an employee paid hourly, the number of
  5 24 hours worked during the pay period; for an employee paid on a
  5 25 percentage of sales or revenue generated, a list of sales or
  5 26 amount of revenue during the pay period; and for an employee
  5 27 paid based on the number of miles or loads performed, the
  5 28 applicable number performed during the pay period.  An employer
  5 29 who provides an electronic statement and gives employees free
  5 30 and unrestricted access to print out the statement is in
  5 31 compliance with the Code section.
  5 32    In amended Code section 91A.8, when any specified violation
  5 33 of Code chapter 91A occurs, even if unintentional, an employer
  5 34 shall be liable for unpaid wages or expenses plus liquidated
  5 35 damages, court costs, and attorney fees incurred in recovering
  6  1 wages.
  6  2    Code section 91A.10(5), which covers retaliatory actions
  6  3 by employers or others, is expanded to cover persons other
  6  4 than employees who act under Code chapter 91A with respect
  6  5 to an employee.  A 90=day period is established during which
  6  6 any action against an employee or other person is rebuttably
  6  7 presumed to be retaliatory.  New subsection 6 is created in
  6  8 Code section 91A.10 to allow the labor commissioner or any
  6  9 injured party to maintain a civil action in any court of proper
  6 10 jurisdiction.  An employer who retaliates against an employee
  6 11 or other person shall compensate the injured party an amount
  6 12 set by the labor commissioner or the court, but not less than
  6 13 $150 for each day of the violation.
  6 14    In new Code section 91A.15, an employer shall not require
  6 15 that an individual be a current employee to be paid an earned
  6 16 commission.
  6 17    An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is subject to a
  6 18 civil penalty of not more than $500 per pay period for each
  6 19 violation.
