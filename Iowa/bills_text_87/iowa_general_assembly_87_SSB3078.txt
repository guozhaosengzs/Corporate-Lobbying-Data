It
is
the
policy
of
this
state
that
a
public
utility
shall
11


operate
in
an
efficient
manner.
If

board
determines
in
the
12


course
of
a
proceeding
conducted
under
section
476.3
or
476.6
13


that
a
utility
is
operating
in
an
inefficient
manner,
or
is
14


not
exercising
ordinary,
prudent
management,
or
in
comparison
15


with

19


believes

a
utility
is
operating
in
such
an
extraordinarily
23


efficient
manner
that
tangible
financial
benefits
result
to
24


the
ratepayer,
the
board
may
increase
the
level
of
profit
or
25


adjust
the
revenue
requirement
for
the
utility.
In
making
its

also
consider
a

public
utility’s
pursuit

board
shall
make
the
following
findings:
1


(1)


The
rate-regulated
public
utility
has
in
effect
a
2


board-approved
energy
efficiency
plan
as
required
under
section
3


476.6,
subsection
15
.
4


(2)


The
find
that
the
rate-regulated
public
utility
5


has
demonstrated
to
the
board
that
the
public
utility
has
6


considered
other
sources
for
long-term
electric
supply
7


and
that
the
facility
or
lease
is
reasonable
when
compared
8


to
other
feasible
alternative
sources
of
supply.
The
9


rate-regulated
public
utility
may
satisfy
the
requirements
10


of
this
subparagraph


paragraph
through
a
competitive
bidding
11


process,
under
rules
adopted
by
the
board,
that
demonstrate
12


the
facility
or
lease
is
a
reasonable
alternative
to
meet
its
13


electric
supply
needs.
