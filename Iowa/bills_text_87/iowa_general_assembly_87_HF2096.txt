  6 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 15    This bill provides that the midwest interstate passenger
  6 16 rail compact is entered into and enacted into law together
  6 17 with several other midwestern states if those states join the
  6 18 compact in substantially the same form.
  6 19    The bill provides that the purposes of the compact are
  6 20 to promote development and implementation of improvements to
  6 21 intercity passenger rail service in the midwest, to coordinate
  6 22 interaction among midwestern state officials on passenger
  6 23 rail issues, to promote development and implementation of
  6 24 plans for high=speed rail passenger service in the midwest
  6 25 and other regions, to work with public and private sectors
  6 26 at all levels to ensure coordination among entities with an
  6 27 interest in passenger rail service and to promote midwestern
  6 28 interests regarding such service, and to support efforts of
  6 29 transportation agencies involved in developing and implementing
  6 30 passenger rail service in the midwest.
  6 31    The bill provides that a commission shall be established to
  6 32 further the purposes of and to carry out the duties specified
  6 33 in the compact.  Each state joining the compact is to be

  7  8 shall have related to the compact and provides for the

  7 16 having already been enacted into law and entered into by nine
  7 17 states, would apply in Iowa effective upon enactment of this
  7 18 bill.

  6 15    This bill provides that the midwest interstate passenger
  6 16 rail compact is entered into and enacted into law together
  6 17 with several other midwestern states if those states join the
  6 18 compact in substantially the same form.

  6 24 plans for high=speed rail passenger service in the midwest
  6 25 and other regions, to work with public and private sectors
  6 26 at all levels to ensure coordination among entities with an
  6 27 interest in passenger rail service and to promote midwestern
  6 28 interests regarding such service, and to support efforts of
  6 29 transportation agencies involved in developing and implementing
  6 30 passenger rail service in the midwest.
  6 31    The bill provides that a commission shall be established to
  6 32 further the purposes of and to carry out the duties specified

  6 15    This bill provides that the midwest interstate passenger
  6 16 rail compact is entered into and enacted into law together
  6 17 with several other midwestern states if those states join the

  6 24 plans for high=speed rail passenger service in the midwest
  6 25 and other regions, to work with public and private sectors
  6 26 at all levels to ensure coordination among entities with an
  6 27 interest in passenger rail service and to promote midwestern
  6 28 interests regarding such service, and to support efforts of
  6 29 transportation agencies involved in developing and implementing
  6 30 passenger rail service in the midwest.
  6 31    The bill provides that a commission shall be established to

  6 15    This bill provides that the midwest interstate passenger

  6 24 plans for high=speed rail passenger service in the midwest
  6 25 and other regions, to work with public and private sectors
  6 26 at all levels to ensure coordination among entities with an
  6 27 interest in passenger rail service and to promote midwestern

  6 30 passenger rail service in the midwest.
  6 31    The bill provides that a commission shall be established to
  6 32 further the purposes of and to carry out the duties specified

  6 15    This bill provides that the midwest interstate passenger

  6 25 and other regions, to work with public and private sectors
  6 26 at all levels to ensure coordination among entities with an
  6 27 interest in passenger rail service and to promote midwestern
  6 28 interests regarding such service, and to support efforts of
  6 29 transportation agencies involved in developing and implementing
  6 30 passenger rail service in the midwest.
  6 31    The bill provides that a commission shall be established to
