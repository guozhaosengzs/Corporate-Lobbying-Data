  9 19 established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in

 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9  4 vehicle for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator
  9  5 of the vehicle, except as provided in this subsection.
  9  6    b.  If an ignition interlock device was installed in a
  9  7 motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's first offense
  9  8 or revocation under this chapter, the device shall be
  9  9 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
  9 10 the department from the defendant's ignition interlock device
  9 11 vendor on a form provided or approved by the department:
  9 12    (1)  Two years after the date the defendant's driver's
  9 13 license revocation period ends.
  9 14    (2)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 15 last attempted to start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol
  9 16 concentration exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC
  9 17 158.6 or last failed a test or retest by a device because
  9 18 the defendant's alcohol concentration exceeded the limit
  9 19 established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:

 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9  5 of the vehicle, except as provided in this subsection.
  9  6    b.  If an ignition interlock device was installed in a
  9  7 motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's first offense
  9  8 or revocation under this chapter, the device shall be
  9  9 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
  9 10 the department from the defendant's ignition interlock device
  9 11 vendor on a form provided or approved by the department:
  9 12    (1)  Two years after the date the defendant's driver's
  9 13 license revocation period ends.
  9 14    (2)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 15 last attempted to start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol
  9 16 concentration exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC
  9 17 158.6 or last failed a test or retest by a device because
  9 18 the defendant's alcohol concentration exceeded the limit
  9 19 established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt

 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration

 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the

 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.

 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires

 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's

 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any

 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires

 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for

 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration

 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level

  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in

 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines

 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor

 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an

 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 12    (1)  Two years after the date the defendant's driver's
  9 13 license revocation period ends.
  9 14    (2)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 15 last attempted to start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol
  9 16 concentration exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC
  9 17 158.6 or last failed a test or retest by a device because
  9 18 the defendant's alcohol concentration exceeded the limit
  9 19 established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 14    (2)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 15 last attempted to start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol
  9 16 concentration exceeded the limit established under 661 IAC
  9 17 158.6 or last failed a test or retest by a device because
  9 18 the defendant's alcohol concentration exceeded the limit
  9 19 established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 17 158.6 or last failed a test or retest by a device because
  9 18 the defendant's alcohol concentration exceeded the limit
  9 19 established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 19 established under 661 IAC 158.6.
  9 20    (3)  One hundred eighty days after the date the defendant
  9 21 last failed to appear at an ignition interlock device vendor
  9 22 service center location for required maintenance, repair,
  9 23 calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise failed to
  9 24 maintain a device as required under 661 IAC ch. 158.
  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.

 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt

 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter

 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be

 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 25    c.  Notwithstanding paragraph "b", an ignition interlock
  9 26 device installed in a motor vehicle as required by this chapter
  9 27 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
  9 28 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.

 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines

 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

  9 29    2.  Upon revocation, and at such times as the department may
  9 30 require by rule, a defendant shall certify to the department
  9 31 that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
  9 32 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by
  9 33 the defendant. The department may adopt rules relating to the
  9 34 form, manner, and circumstances under which a defendant is
  9 35 required to submit a certification to the department that the
 10  1 defendant has installed an approved ignition interlock device
 10  2 in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the defendant.
 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.

 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an

 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human

 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest

 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an

 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial

 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent

 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human

 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including

 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to

 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10  3    3.  a.  An ignition interlock device indigent user fund is
 10  4 created in the state treasury. The fund shall be administered
 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:

 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 10  5 by the department and shall consist of moneys collected by the
 10  6 department under this subsection. The moneys in the fund are
 10  7 appropriated to and shall be used by the department to assist
 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently

 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the
 10 18 monthly ignition interlock device user fee shall be set by the
 10 19 department so that the moneys in the ignition interlock device
 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.

 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's

 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this

 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10  8 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 10  9 use of the devices. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys in
 10 10 the fund at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to any
 10 11 other fund but shall remain in the fund for expenditure for
 10 12 subsequent fiscal years.
 10 13    b.  Each month, the department shall assess an ignition
 10 14 interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 10 15 device. All ignition interlock device user fees shall be
 10 16 collected by the department and deposited in the ignition
 10 17 interlock device indigent user fund. The amount of the

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income

 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 20 indigent user fund are sufficient to assist all indigent users
 10 21 of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of the
 10 22 devices.
 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.

 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,

 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently

 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with

 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently

 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and

 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including

 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of

 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt

 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 23    c.  A person is indigent for the purposes of this subsection
 10 24 if any of the following apply:
 10 25    (1)  The person has an income level at or below one hundred
 10 26 twenty=five percent of the United States poverty level as
 10 27 defined by the most recently revised poverty income guidelines
 10 28 published by the United States department of health and human
 10 29 services, and the state department of transportation determines
 10 30 that the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 10 31 interlock device. In making the determination of a person's
 10 32 ability to pay for the cost of a device, the department shall
 10 33 consider not only the person's income, but also the person's
 10 34 other assets, including but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds,
 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred
 11  2 twenty=five percent, but at or below two hundred percent, of
 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition

 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if

 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to

 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised

 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the

 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income

 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including

 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 10 35 and any other property.
 11  1    (2)  The person has an income level greater than one hundred

 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11  3 the United States poverty level as defined by the most recently
 11  4 revised poverty income guidelines published by the United
 11  5 States department of health and human services, and the state
 11  6 department of transportation determines that paying for the
 11  7 ignition interlock device would cause the person substantial
 11  8 hardship. In determining whether substantial hardship would
 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate
 11 16 indigency.
 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests

 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle

 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to

 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11  9 result, the department shall consider not only the person's
 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 10 income, but also the person's other assets, including but not
 11 11 limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.
 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 11 17                           EXPLANATION
 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 12    d.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
 11 13 subsection, including but not limited to the manner used to
 11 14 determine the monthly ignition interlock device user fee and
 11 15 the accepted form and manner in which a person may demonstrate

 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including

 11 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 20    This bill requires an operating=while=intoxicated (OWI)
 11 21 defendant to install ignition interlock devices in all motor
 11 22 vehicles owned or operated by the defendant upon revocation
 11 23 of the defendant's driver's license. The bill also requires
 11 24 courts to order an OWI defendant to install ignition interlock
 11 25 devices in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 11 26 defendant upon a conviction for or as a condition of a deferred
 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of

 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date

 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the

 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the

 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level

 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
 14 10 but not limited to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property.

 11 27 judgment for an OWI violation. The bill amends provisions
 11 28 relating to driver's license revocations and eligibility for
 11 29 issuance of temporary restricted licenses to reflect these
 11 30 requirements. The bill reorganizes such provisions but does
 11 31 not otherwise alter the requirements relating to driver's
 11 32 license revocations and eligibility for issuance of temporary
 11 33 restricted licenses provided under current law.
 11 34    The bill requires the commissioner of public safety to adopt
 11 35 rules requiring ignition interlock devices to be equipped with
 12  1 a camera and a global positioning system of a type approved by
 12  2 the commissioner, and to adopt rules requiring the devices to
 12  3 obtain a digital image of the driver when the device requests
 12  4 a test, record the location of the test, and transmit the
 12  5 image, the location data, and a notification of any failed test
 12  6 result in real=time to the device's vendor, the department of
 12  7 transportation (DOT), or the DOT's designee.
 12  8    The bill provides that an ignition interlock device
 12  9 installed in a motor vehicle as required by Code chapter 321J
 12 10 (operating=while=intoxicated) must be installed in the vehicle
 12 11 for as long as the defendant is the owner or operator of the
 12 12 vehicle, with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 12 13 was installed in a motor vehicle as a result of the defendant's
 12 14 first OWI offense or revocation, the device shall be
 12 15 uninstalled after the later of the following, as certified to
 12 16 the DOT from the defendant's ignition interlock device vendor
 12 17 on a form provided or approved by the DOT: two years after
 12 18 the date the defendant's driver's license revocation period
 12 19 ends, 180 days after the date the defendant last attempted to
 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 23 exceeded the established limit, or 180 days after the date
 12 24 the defendant last failed to appear at an ignition interlock
 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times
 12 34 as the DOT may require by rule, a defendant must certify to
 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a
 13  8 participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the
 13 11 person's offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.
 13 12    The bill provides for an ignition interlock device indigent
 13 13 user fund administered by the DOT consisting of moneys
 13 14 collected by the DOT under the bill. The bill appropriates
 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock
 13 25 device devices in paying for the use of the devices.
 13 26    A person is indigent under the bill if the person has an
 13 27 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty
 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human

 12 20 start a vehicle while the defendant's alcohol concentration
 12 21 exceeded the established limit or last failed a test or retest
 12 22 by a device because the defendant's alcohol concentration

 12 25 device vendor service center location for required maintenance,
 12 26 repair, calibration, or replacement of a device, or otherwise
 12 27 failed to maintain a device as required. Under current law,
 12 28 the established alcohol concentration limit for a test by an
 12 29 ignition interlock device is .025. However, the bill provides
 12 30 that an ignition interlock device installed in a motor vehicle
 12 31 shall not be uninstalled if the defendant has been convicted of
 12 32 tampering with or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 12 33    The bill requires that upon revocation, and at such times

 12 35 the DOT that the defendant has installed an approved ignition
 13  1 interlock device in all motor vehicles owned or operated by the
 13  2 defendant.
 13  3    Under current law, in any circumstance in which Code chapter
 13  4 321J requires the installation of an ignition interlock device
 13  5 in all vehicles owned or operated by a person as a condition
 13  6 of the person's license or privilege to operate noncommercial
 13  7 motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person to be a

 13  9 monitoring program established pursuant to Code chapter 901D if
 13 10 the person's offense qualifies as an eligible offense and the

 13 15 the moneys in the fund for use by the DOT to assist indigent
 13 16 users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the use of
 13 17 the devices. Each month, the DOT is required to assess an
 13 18 ignition interlock device user fee to each user of an ignition
 13 19 interlock device. All ignition interlock device user fees must
 13 20 be collected by the DOT and deposited in the ignition interlock
 13 21 device indigent user fund. The amount of the monthly ignition
 13 22 interlock device user fee shall be set by the DOT so that the
 13 23 moneys in the ignition interlock device indigent user fund are
 13 24 sufficient to assist all indigent users of ignition interlock

 13 28 level as defined by the most recently revised poverty income
 13 29 guidelines published by the U.S. department of health and human
 13 30 services, and the DOT determines that the person is unable to
 13 31 pay for the cost of an ignition interlock device. In making
 13 32 the determination of a person's ability to pay for the cost of
 13 33 a device, the DOT must consider not only the person's income,
 13 34 but also the person's other assets, including but not limited
 13 35 to cash, stocks, bonds, and any other property. A person is
 14  1 also indigent under the bill if the person has an income level
 14  2 greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200 percent, of the
 14  3 U.S. poverty level as defined by the most recently revised
 14  4 poverty income guidelines published by the U.S. department
 14  5 of health and human services, and the DOT determines that
 14  6 paying for the ignition interlock device would cause the person
 14  7 substantial hardship. In determining whether substantial
 14  8 hardship would result, the DOT must consider not only the
 14  9 person's income, but also the person's other assets, including
