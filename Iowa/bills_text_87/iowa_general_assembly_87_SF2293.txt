  6  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 10    This bill relates to motor vehicle dealers, franchisers, and
  6 11 franchisees.
  6 12    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer's or
  6 13 manufacturer's established place of business is the place
  6 14 actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by
  6 15 the dealer or manufacturer where the dealer's or manufacturer's
  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 10    This bill relates to motor vehicle dealers, franchisers, and
  6 11 franchisees.
  6 12    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer's or
  6 13 manufacturer's established place of business is the place
  6 14 actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by
  6 15 the dealer or manufacturer where the dealer's or manufacturer's
  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 10    This bill relates to motor vehicle dealers, franchisers, and
  6 11 franchisees.
  6 12    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer's or
  6 13 manufacturer's established place of business is the place
  6 14 actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by
  6 15 the dealer or manufacturer where the dealer's or manufacturer's
  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6 10    This bill relates to motor vehicle dealers, franchisers, and
  6 11 franchisees.
  6 12    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer's or
  6 13 manufacturer's established place of business is the place
  6 14 actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by
  6 15 the dealer or manufacturer where the dealer's or manufacturer's
  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6 12    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer's or
  6 13 manufacturer's established place of business is the place
  6 14 actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by
  6 15 the dealer or manufacturer where the dealer's or manufacturer's
  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6 12    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer's or
  6 13 manufacturer's established place of business is the place
  6 14 actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by
  6 15 the dealer or manufacturer where the dealer's or manufacturer's
  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping

  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of

  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the

 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not

 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a

 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor

  6 13 manufacturer's established place of business is the place
  6 14 actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by
  6 15 the dealer or manufacturer where the dealer's or manufacturer's
  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of

 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components

  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6 16 books and records are kept and a large share of the dealer's
  6 17 or manufacturer's business is transacted. If a dealer has an
  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to

 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the

 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components

  6 18 established place of business in more than one city, the dealer
  6 19 must secure a separate and distinct certificate of registration
  6 20 and number plates for each such place of business. The bill
  6 21 permits a dealer with more than one established place of
  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,

 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,

  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6 22 business to designate one such location for purposes of keeping
  6 23 all the dealer's books and records, regardless of the line=make
  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to

 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section

  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any

 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,

  6 24 of motor vehicles to which the books and records pertain,
  6 25 by submitting a written certification to the department of
  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section

  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  6 26 transportation (DOT).  The bill provides that if a dealer has
  6 27 designated one established place of business for purposes of
  6 28 keeping all the dealer's books and records, "established place
  6 29 of business" also includes any place actually occupied either
  6 30 continuously or at regular periods by the dealer where a large
  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to

 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section

 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a

 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of

  6 31 share of the dealer's business is transacted but not where the
  6 32 dealer's books and records are kept.
  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not

 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section

  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making

  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.

 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,

  6 33    Under current law, a motor vehicle dealer may charge a
  6 34 documentary fee not to exceed $180 for each motor vehicle
  6 35 sold in a transaction. A "documentary fee" is a fee that may
  7  1 be charged to a customer by a motor vehicle dealer for the
  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of

  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.

  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was

  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the

  7  2 preparation of documents related to an application for motor
  7  3 vehicle registration and an application for issuance of a
  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly

  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components

  7  4 certificate of title, and the performance of other related
  7  5 services for the customer. The bill provides that beginning
  7  6 January 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the maximum amount
  7  7 a motor vehicle dealer may charge for a documentary fee shall
  7  8 be subject to an annual percentage adjustment equal to the
  7  9 percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban
  7 10 consumers published in the federal register by the United
  7 11 States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics. On or
  7 12 before December 15 of each year, the bill requires the DOT to
  7 13 publish the maximum amount a motor vehicle dealer may charge
  7 14 for a documentary fee for the next calendar year calculated
  7 15 based on the percentage change in the consumer price index for
  7 16 all urban consumers for the most recent available 12=month
  7 17 period, rounded to the nearest whole cent. By operation of
  7 18 law, the maximum documentary fee permitted will be reduced
  7 19 by $25 after the DOT has implemented a program allowing for
  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering

  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a

  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the

 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the

  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is

  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components

  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components

  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles

  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components

  7 20 electronic applications, titling, registering, and funds
  7 21 transfers for motor vehicles.
  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for

  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the

  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by

  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its

  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of

  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the

  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average

  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a

  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,

  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of

  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components

  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for

  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is

  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its

  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the

  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's

  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average

  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of

 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's

  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  7 22    The bill requires a motor vehicle franchiser to specify
  7 23 in writing to each of the franchiser's franchisees operating
  7 24 in this state the franchisee's obligations for preparation,
  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail

  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was

  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.

  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  7 25 delivery, and warranty services related to the franchiser's
  7 26 products. The franchiser must compensate the franchisee for
  7 27 the warranty services the franchiser requires the franchisee
  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a

  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,

  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to

 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  7 28 to provide, including but not limited to warranty and recall
  7 29 obligations related to repairing and servicing motor vehicles
  7 30 of the franchiser and all parts and components authorized
  7 31 by the manufacturer to be installed in or manufactured for
  7 32 installation in such motor vehicles.
  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section

 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,

  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's

  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by

  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of

  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's

  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average

  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil

  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,

 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the

  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  7 33    The bill requires the franchiser to provide to the
  7 34 franchisee a schedule of compensation that specifies reasonable
  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and

  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable

  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a

 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the

  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's

  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the

 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,

 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,

  7 35 amounts the franchiser will pay to the franchisee for such
  8  1 warranty services, including for parts, labor, diagnostics, and
  8  2 other related services. The schedule of compensation must also
  8  3 specify reasonable time periods under which the franchisee is
  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price
  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any

 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to

 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional

  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee
  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor
 11  9 vehicles and any franchiser of new motor vehicle transmissions,
 11 10 engines, or rear axles that separately warrants such components
 11 11 to customers.

  8  4 required to perform such warranty services.
  8  5    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8  6 for parts, the franchiser may add one to the franchisee's
  8  7 average percentage markup, which is the percentage difference
  8  8 calculated as a decimal between the price paid by the
  8  9 franchisee for parts and the price at which parts are sold by
  8 10 the franchisee at retail, and multiply the result by the price

  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average

  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.
  9 21    The bill prohibits a franchiser from requiring a franchisee

 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of
 11  4 compensation, or disallowing a claim, for warranty parts,
 11  5 repairs, or services if 12 months or more have passed since the
 11  6 claim was submitted.
 11  7    The bill provides that the obligations set forth in the bill
 11  8 apply to any franchiser  who manufactures or distributes motor

  8 11 paid by the franchisee for the parts, including shipping and
  8 12 other charges.
  8 13    The bill specifies that in determining reasonable amounts
  8 14 for labor=related warranty services, the franchiser must
  8 15 consider the prevailing wage rates paid by other franchisees in
  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or
  8 18 oil service. Under current law, a franchisee's community is
  8 19 the franchisee's area of responsibility as stipulated in the
  8 20 franchise. The franchiser may calculate the franchisee's labor
  8 21 rate by dividing the total amount of retail sales attributable
  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its
  8 25 average percentage markup for parts or its labor rate by
  8 26 submitting to the franchiser copies of 100 sequential retail
  8 27 service orders paid by the franchisee's customers, or all of
  8 28 the franchisee's retail service orders paid by the franchisee's
  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's
  9  6 approval. If the franchiser denies the establishment of the
  9  7 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate, the
  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil

  9 22 to establish an average percentage markup or labor rate by a
  9 23 methodology, or by requiring the submission of information,
  9 24 that is unduly burdensome or time=consuming to the franchisee,
  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or

  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of
  9 35 factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and franchisees the
 10  1 expected date by which the necessary parts and equipment will
 10  2 be available to franchisees for the correction of the defects,
 10  3 and failing to compensate any of the franchiser's franchisees
 10  4 operating in this state for repairs relating to a recall.
 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to

 10  5    The bill provides that a claim made by a franchisee for
 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's

 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the

  8 16 the franchisee's community, not including wage rates paid for
  8 17 the performance of routine maintenance such as tire service or

  8 22 to labor for warranty services by the number of hours of labor
  8 23 spent to generate the retail sales.
  8 24    The bill provides that a franchisee may establish its

  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's

  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating

 10  6 warranty services must be paid within 30 days after the claim's
 10  7 approval. A franchiser must either approve or deny a claim
 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing
 10 12 within 30 days after the receipt of the claim, the claim shall
 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.
 10 15    The bill states that a franchiser may deny a franchisee's
 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
 11  1 322.2, subsection 13. Under current law, Code section
 11  2 322.2, subsection 13, prohibits a manufacturer, distributor,
 11  3 or importer of motor vehicles from reducing the amount of

  8 29 customers in a 90=day period, whichever is less, for services
  8 30 provided within the previous 180=day period. The franchiser is
  8 31 prohibited from considering retail service orders or portions
  8 32 of retail service orders attributable to routine maintenance
  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The
  9  1 franchiser must then approve or deny the establishment of the
  9  2 franchisee's average percentage markup or labor rate. If the
  9  3 franchiser approves the establishment of the franchisee's
  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's

  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.

  9 25 including but not limited to requiring part=by=part or
  9 26 transaction=by=transaction calculations. The bill prohibits a
  9 27 franchisee from requesting a change in the franchisee's average
  9 28 percentage markup more than once in any one=year period.
  9 29    The bill provides that the amounts in the schedule of
  9 30 compensation shall not be less than the amounts charged by the
  9 31 franchisee to retail customers for such services, provided the
  9 32 amounts are reasonable.
  9 33    The bill prohibits a franchiser from failing to perform any
  9 34 warranty obligation, failing to include in written notices of

  8 33 such as tire service or oil service.
  8 34    Within 30 days of receiving the franchisee's submission,
  8 35 the franchiser may choose to audit the submitted orders. The

  9  4 average percentage markup or labor rate, the amounts calculated
  9  5 shall go into effect 45 days after the date of the franchiser's

  9  8 franchisee may file a complaint with the DOT and a hearing
  9  9 shall be held before the department of inspections and appeals
  9 10 (DIA).  The bill provides that the franchiser shall have the
  9 11 burden of proof to establish that the franchiser's denial was
  9 12 reasonable. If the DIA finds the denial was not reasonable,
  9 13 the denial is deemed a violation of Code chapter 322A and
  9 14 the DIA is required to determine the franchisee's average
  9 15 percentage markup or labor rate for purposes of calculating
  9 16 reasonable amounts for the schedule of compensation. In making
  9 17 the determination, the DIA is prohibited from considering
  9 18 retail service orders or portions of retail service orders
  9 19 attributable to routine maintenance such as tire service or oil
  9 20 service.

 10  8 within 30 days after the franchiser receives a claim if the
 10  9 claim is submitted on a form generally used by the franchiser
 10 10 and the claim contains the information required by the
 10 11 franchiser. If a franchiser does not deny a claim in writing

 10 13 be deemed to be approved by the franchiser and payment shall be
 10 14 made to the franchisee within 30 days.

 10 16 claim for compensation for warranty or recall services if
 10 17 the franchisee's claim is based on a repair not related to
 10 18 warranty or recall services, the repair was not properly
 10 19 performed, the franchisee lacks the required documentation for
 10 20 the claim, the franchisee fails to comply with the terms and
 10 21 conditions of the franchiser's warranty or recall compensation
 10 22 program, or the franchiser has a bona fide belief based on
 10 23 factual evidence that the franchisee's claim was intentionally
 10 24 submitted containing a false or fraudulent statement or
 10 25 misrepresentation. A franchiser may reject, but shall not
 10 26 deny, a claim based solely on a franchisee's unintentional
 10 27 failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement,
 10 28 such as a clerical error, that does not otherwise affect the
 10 29 legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for such a
 10 30 failure, the franchisee may resubmit a corrected claim in a
 10 31 timely manner to the franchiser.
 10 32    The bill provides that the requirement to approve a claim
 10 33 within 30 days, or to pay an approved claim within 30 days,
 10 34 shall not be construed to preclude denials, reductions,
 10 35 or chargebacks not otherwise prohibited under Code section
