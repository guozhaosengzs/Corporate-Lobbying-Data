  3 29    5.  Registration as a hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting

  3 32 hunting or fishing license or tag other than those licenses or
  3 33 tags the hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting or fishing
  3 34 guide may lawfully obtain for the outfitter's or guide's
  3 35 personal use.

  4 14 or 484C.
  4 15    9.  A person who violates this section or the rules adopted

  4 17 each violation.
  4 18                           EXPLANATION
  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged
  4 22 in the business of a hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting
  4 23 or fishing guide.  The bill defines a "hunting or fishing
  4 24 outfitter" or "hunting or fishing guide" as a person who
  4 25 receives compensation in return for providing outfitter
  4 26 services to a hunter or fisher.  The bill defines "outfitter
  4 27 services" as services defined by the natural resource
  4 28 commission by rule, including but not limited to the provision
  4 29 of hunting or fishing outfitters or guides, equipment, stands,
  4 30 blinds, decoys, boats, access to land or waters to be hunted,

  4 33 register hunting or fishing outfitters or hunting or fishing
  4 34 guides upon application and payment of an annual fee determined
  4 35 by rule of the commission. A person who provides access to
  5  1 that person's private property for hunting or fishing without
  5  2 compensation or  a person who primarily provides hunting or
  5  3 fishing equipment at retail is not considered a hunting or
  5  4 fishing outfitter or hunting or fishing guide who is subject
  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or
  5 10 fishing outfitter or the hunting or fishing guide. Information
  5 11 concerning the location and acreage of any land or waters to be
  5 12 hunted or fished shall be treated as a confidential record by
  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released
  5 16 would give advantage to competitors and serve no public
  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of
  5 24 the commission of trespass while hunting deer, or has been
  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is
  5 29 required to verify with the department of natural resources, as
  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than
  6 13 $1,875.

  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged

  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to

  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident

  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.

  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.

  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged
  4 22 in the business of a hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting
  4 23 or fishing guide.  The bill defines a "hunting or fishing
  4 24 outfitter" or "hunting or fishing guide" as a person who
  4 25 receives compensation in return for providing outfitter
  4 26 services to a hunter or fisher.  The bill defines "outfitter

  5  1 that person's private property for hunting or fishing without
  5  2 compensation or  a person who primarily provides hunting or
  5  3 fishing equipment at retail is not considered a hunting or
  5  4 fishing outfitter or hunting or fishing guide who is subject
  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or
  5 10 fishing outfitter or the hunting or fishing guide. Information
  5 11 concerning the location and acreage of any land or waters to be
  5 12 hunted or fished shall be treated as a confidential record by
  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released
  5 16 would give advantage to competitors and serve no public
  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of
  5 24 the commission of trespass while hunting deer, or has been
  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is
  5 29 required to verify with the department of natural resources, as
  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than
  6 13 $1,875.

  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to

  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged

  5  3 fishing equipment at retail is not considered a hunting or
  5  4 fishing outfitter or hunting or fishing guide who is subject
  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or

  5 12 hunted or fished shall be treated as a confidential record by
  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection

  5 16 would give advantage to competitors and serve no public
  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of
  5 24 the commission of trespass while hunting deer, or has been
  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is
  5 29 required to verify with the department of natural resources, as
  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  4 18                           EXPLANATION
  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged
  4 22 in the business of a hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting
  4 23 or fishing guide.  The bill defines a "hunting or fishing
  4 24 outfitter" or "hunting or fishing guide" as a person who
  4 25 receives compensation in return for providing outfitter
  4 26 services to a hunter or fisher.  The bill defines "outfitter
  4 27 services" as services defined by the natural resource
  4 28 commission by rule, including but not limited to the provision
  4 29 of hunting or fishing outfitters or guides, equipment, stands,
  4 30 blinds, decoys, boats, access to land or waters to be hunted,

  4 33 register hunting or fishing outfitters or hunting or fishing
  4 34 guides upon application and payment of an annual fee determined

  5  1 that person's private property for hunting or fishing without
  5  2 compensation or  a person who primarily provides hunting or
  5  3 fishing equipment at retail is not considered a hunting or
  5  4 fishing outfitter or hunting or fishing guide who is subject
  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or
  5 10 fishing outfitter or the hunting or fishing guide. Information
  5 11 concerning the location and acreage of any land or waters to be
  5 12 hunted or fished shall be treated as a confidential record by
  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released
  5 16 would give advantage to competitors and serve no public
  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of
  5 24 the commission of trespass while hunting deer, or has been
  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is
  5 29 required to verify with the department of natural resources, as
  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than
  6 13 $1,875.

  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged

  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released
  5 16 would give advantage to competitors and serve no public
  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or

  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of

  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is
  5 29 required to verify with the department of natural resources, as
  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection

  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to

  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of

  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to

  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or

  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released

  5 17 purpose.

  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of

  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is

  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.

  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location

  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection

  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to

  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to

  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.

  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  4 18                           EXPLANATION
  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged
  4 22 in the business of a hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting
  4 23 or fishing guide.  The bill defines a "hunting or fishing
  4 24 outfitter" or "hunting or fishing guide" as a person who
  4 25 receives compensation in return for providing outfitter
  4 26 services to a hunter or fisher.  The bill defines "outfitter
  4 27 services" as services defined by the natural resource
  4 28 commission by rule, including but not limited to the provision
  4 29 of hunting or fishing outfitters or guides, equipment, stands,
  4 30 blinds, decoys, boats, access to land or waters to be hunted,

  4 33 register hunting or fishing outfitters or hunting or fishing
  4 34 guides upon application and payment of an annual fee determined

  5  1 that person's private property for hunting or fishing without
  5  2 compensation or  a person who primarily provides hunting or
  5  3 fishing equipment at retail is not considered a hunting or
  5  4 fishing outfitter or hunting or fishing guide who is subject
  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or
  5 10 fishing outfitter or the hunting or fishing guide. Information
  5 11 concerning the location and acreage of any land or waters to be
  5 12 hunted or fished shall be treated as a confidential record by
  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released
  5 16 would give advantage to competitors and serve no public
  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of
  5 24 the commission of trespass while hunting deer, or has been
  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is
  5 29 required to verify with the department of natural resources, as
  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to
  6  1 whom outfitter services will be or are being provided.
  6  2    Nothing in the bill is be construed to entitle a nonresident
  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged
  4 22 in the business of a hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting

  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or

  5 12 hunted or fished shall be treated as a confidential record by
  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released

  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of

  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to

  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.

  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location

  4 21    This bill provides for the registration of persons engaged
  4 22 in the business of a hunting or fishing outfitter or hunting
  4 23 or fishing guide.  The bill defines a "hunting or fishing
  4 24 outfitter" or "hunting or fishing guide" as a person who
  4 25 receives compensation in return for providing outfitter
  4 26 services to a hunter or fisher.  The bill defines "outfitter

  5  1 that person's private property for hunting or fishing without
  5  2 compensation or  a person who primarily provides hunting or
  5  3 fishing equipment at retail is not considered a hunting or
  5  4 fishing outfitter or hunting or fishing guide who is subject
  5  5 to registration for purposes of the bill. An applicant shall
  5  6 identify all parcels of land or waters which are under the
  5  7 lawful control of the applicant, and identify the location
  5  8 and acreage of any land or waters to be hunted or fished, and
  5  9 the equipment and services to be provided by the hunting or
  5 10 fishing outfitter or the hunting or fishing guide. Information

  5 12 hunted or fished shall be treated as a confidential record by
  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection
  5 15 6, relating to reports to public agencies, which if released
  5 16 would give advantage to competitors and serve no public
  5 17 purpose.
  5 18    An applicant shall not be registered as a hunting or fishing
  5 19 outfitter or guide if the person is or has been subject to
  5 20 cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license issued
  5 21 by the department of natural resources or has pled guilty or
  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of
  5 24 the commission of trespass while hunting deer, or has been
  5 25 subject to cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a similar
  5 26 license, or pled guilty or been convicted of trespass while
  5 27 hunting deer in another state.
  5 28    A registered hunting or fishing outfitter or guide is
  5 29 required to verify with the department of natural resources, as
  5 30 provided by rule, that any person to whom  hunting or fishing
  5 31 outfitter or guide services are provided is properly licensed
  5 32 to hunt or fish in this state for the species sought by that
  5 33 person.
  5 34    The bill specifies the duties and responsibilities of a
  5 35 hunting or fishing outfitter or guide to a hunter or fisher to

  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.
  6  9    A violator is guilty of a serious misdemeanor for each
  6 10 violation of the bill or rules adopted under the bill. A
  6 11 serious misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more
  6 12 than one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than

  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection

  5 22 been convicted of such license violations or violations of
  5 23 similar statutes, or has pled guilty or been convicted of
  5 24 the commission of trespass while hunting deer, or has been

  6  3 hunter or fisher to any hunting or fishing license or tag in
  6  4 this state other than those licenses or tags the nonresident
  6  5 hunter is otherwise eligible to lawfully obtain for the
  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
  6  7    The bill does not apply to activities that are conducted on a
  6  8 hunting preserve.

  5 13 the department of natural resources pursuant to Code section
  5 14 22.7, subsection 3, relating to trade secrets, and subsection

  6  6 hunter's or fisher's use.
