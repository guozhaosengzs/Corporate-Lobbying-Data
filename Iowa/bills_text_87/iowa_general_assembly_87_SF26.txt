  1 10    2.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary regarding
  1 11 limitations of actions, an action under this section may be
  1 12 brought at any time during the lifetime of the woman.
  1 13    3.  The signing of a consent form by the woman prior to the
  1 14 abortion shall not negate the cause of action, but may reduce
  1 15 the recovery of damages to the extent that the content of the
  1 16 consent form informed the woman of the risk of the type of
  1 17 injuries for which the woman is seeking damages.
  1 18    4.  This section shall not be construed to render any other
  1 19 statutory or common law cause of action for medical malpractice
  1 20 otherwise available inapplicable to abortion procedures or
  1 21 diminish the nature or the extent of those causes of action.
  1 22 The cause of action expressly specified in this section is in
  1 23 addition to any other statutory or common law cause of action.
  1 24    5.  A cause of action shall not be brought under this section

  1 34 grief, anxiety, worry, mortification, shock, humiliation, and
  1 35 indignity, as well as physical pain.
  2  1    d.  "Informed consent" means the duty of a physician to
  2  2 disclose all facts about the nature of the procedure, the risks
  2  3 of the procedure, and the alternatives to the procedure that a
  2  4 reasonable patient would consider significant to the patient's
  2  5 decision to undergo or forego an abortion.
  2  6    e.  "Medical emergency" means any condition which, on the
  2  7 basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so
  2  8 complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to
  2  9 necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert
  2 10 her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of
  2 11 substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily
  2 12 function.
  2 13                           EXPLANATION

  2 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 16    This bill establishes a cause of action that may be
  2 17 maintained by a woman upon whom an abortion has been performed
  2 18 against the physician who performed the abortion to recover
  2 19 damages for any emotional distress, whether or not independent
  2 20 of a physical injury, proximately caused as the result of the
  2 21 physician's negligence or failure to obtain informed consent
  2 22 prior to performance of the abortion.  The action may be
  2 23 brought at any time during the lifetime of the woman.  The
  2 24 bill provides that the signing of a consent form by the woman
  2 25 prior to the abortion does not negate the cause of action,
  2 26 but may reduce the recovery of damages to the extent that the
  2 27 content of the consent form informed the woman of the risk of
  2 28 the type of injuries for which the woman is seeking damages.
  2 29 The bill also provides that other existing  statutory or common
  2 30 law causes of action for medical malpractice are not to be
  2 31 construed to be rendered inapplicable to abortion procedures or
  2 32 diminish the nature or the extent of those causes of action.
  2 33 The cause of action expressly specified in the bill is in
  2 34 addition to any other statutory or common law cause of action.
  2 35 A cause of action is prohibited under the bill if the abortion
  3  1 was performed due to a medical emergency.
  3  2    The bill defines "abortion", "damages", "emotional
  3  3 distress", "informed consent", and "medical emergency" for the
  3  4 purposes of the bill.
