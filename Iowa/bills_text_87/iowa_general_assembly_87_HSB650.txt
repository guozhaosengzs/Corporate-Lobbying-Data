This
bill
relates
to
the
funding
and
use
of
funding
for
1


various
education
programs.
2


Current
Code
section
257.10,
subsection
11,
establishes
an
3


early
intervention
categorical
funding
supplement
for
school
4


districts
and
requires
the
use
of
such
funds
to
comply
with
5


the
requirements
of
Code
chapter
256D
(Iowa
early
intervention
6


block
grant
program).
Code
chapter
256D
requires
school
7


districts
to
expend
funds
for
class
size
reduction
and
for
8


uses
intended
to
achieve
a
higher
level
of
student
success
9


in
the
basic
skills,
especially
reading.
Under
current
law,
10


Code
chapter
256D
is
repealed
effective
July
1,
2018.
The
11


bill
changes
the
purposes
for
which
the
early
intervention
12


categorical
funding
supplement
may
be
expended
to
be
any
school
13


general
fund
purpose.
14


The
section
of
the
bill
amending
Code
section
257.10,
15


subsection
11,
applies
to
school
budget
years
beginning
on
or
16


after
July
1,
2018.
17


Current
Code
section
284.6
provides
that
funds
received
18


by
school
districts
for
professional
development
pursuant
to
19


Code
section
257.10,
subsection
10,
or
Code
section
257.37A,
20


subsection
2,
may
be
used
to
implement
the
professional
21


development
provisions
of
the
teacher
career
paths
and
22


leadership
roles.
The
bill
amends
the
provisions
governing
use
23


of
such
funds
to
provide
that
the
permissible
uses
are
those
24


purposes
determined
by
the
board
of
directors
to
implement
25


the
professional
development
provisions
of
the
teacher
career
26


paths
and
leadership
roles.
The
bill
also
strikes
a
provision
27


that
requires
moneys
received
pursuant
to
Code
section
257.10,
28


subsection
10,
or
Code
section
257.37A,
subsection
2,
to
be
29


maintained
as
a
separate
listing
within
a
school
district’s
30


or
area
education
agency’s
budget
for
funds
received
and
31


expenditures
made
from
such
moneys.
32


Under
current
law,
school
districts
are
required
to
submit
33


to
the
department
of
education
for
approval
program
plans
and
34


requests
for
a
modified
supplemental

at-risk
students,
secondary
students
who
attend
alternative
1


programs
and
alternative
schools,
and

and

dropout
prevention.
The
bill
strikes
the
requirement
for
3


submission
to
and
approval
by
the
department
of
education
and
4


instead
allows
such
program
plans
to
be
approved
by
resolution
5


of
the
school
district
board
of
directors.
The
bill
also
6


removes
other
factors
required
by
the
department
of
education
7


from
the
list
of
requirements
for
program
plans.
When
the
8


board
of
directors
of
a
school
district
requests
to
use
a
9


modified
supplemental
amount
for
costs
for
the
excess
cost
10


of
an
adopted
program,
the
bill
requires
such
a
request
to
11


be
submitted
to
the
school
budget
review
committee
instead
12


of
the
department
of
education.
Requests
are
required
to
be
13


approved
if
the
request
complies
with
the
school
district’s
14


adopted
program
plan.
Only
if
the
request
violates
the
15


school
district’s
adopted
program
plan
may
the
school
budget
16


review
committee
return
the
request
to
the
school
district
for
17


revision
and
resubmission.
18


The
bill
adds
the
salary
and
benefits
of
administrative
19


staff
who
are
working
with
students
who
are
participating
20


in
at-risk
or
dropout
prevention
programs,
alternative
21


programs,
and
alternative
schools,
in
a
traditional
or
22


alternative
setting,
to
the
list
of
permissible
uses
of
23


funding.
In
addition,
the
bill
authorizes
the
expenditure
24


of
such
funding
for
any
purpose
determined
by
the
board
of
25


directors
to
meet
the
standards
for
the
adopted
program
and
26


any
purpose
determined
by
the
board
of
directors
that
directly
27


or
indirectly
benefits
students
participating
in
the
adopted
28


program.
29


Current
Code
section
298A.8
allows
a
school
district
board


30


of
directors,
by
resolution,
to
transfer
funds
from
the
school
31


district’s
general
fund
to
the
student
activity
fund
an
amount
32


necessary
to
purchase
protective
and
safety
equipment
required
33


for
any
extracurricular
interscholastic
athletic
contest
34


or
competition.
The
bill
