  3 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    This bill modifies provisions that require school districts
  3 20 to retain in the third grade certain students, and adds a
  3 21 provision to require school districts to offer, under certain
  3 22 conditions, an intensive summer reading program for students in
  3 23 kindergarten through grade three whose reading is deficient.
  3 24    The bill eliminates a requirement that a school district
  3 25 retain a student in grade three if the student is not reading
  3 26 proficiently and is persistently at risk in reading, the
  3 27 student's parent or guardian did not enroll the student in
  3 28 an intensive summer reading program, and the student does
  3 29 not qualify for a good cause exemption.  A current provision
  3 30 that requires the state board of education to adopt standards
  3 31 regarding a student's progress toward reading proficiency
  3 32 is modified to eliminate language relating to a student's
  3 33 promotion to grade four.
  3 34    Under the bill, when the school district notifies a parent or
  3 35 guardian that the parent or guardian may enroll the student in
  4  1 an intensive summer reading program, the notification must be
  4  2 in writing.  Students continue to be exempt from participating
  4  3 in an intensive summer reading program for good cause, the
  4  4 qualifications for which are listed in Code section 279.68(5).
  4  5    The bill requires school districts to provide intensive
  4  6 summer reading programs, beginning in the summer of 2019,
  4  7 for students who are enrolled in kindergarten through grade
  4  8 two, but only if the general assembly appropriates funds for
  4  9 the programs.  The department of education may waive the
  4 10 requirement for an intensive summer reading program for grade
  4 11 three students for 2018 and for kindergarten through grade two
  4 12 students for 2019.  For any year in which the general assembly
  4 13 appropriates funds for such programs, if a school district does
  4 14 not obtain a waiver and if a student enrolled in kindergarten
  4 15 through grade two is persistently at risk in reading at the
  4 16 end of the school year, the school district must notify the
  4 17 student's parent or guardian in writing that the parent or
