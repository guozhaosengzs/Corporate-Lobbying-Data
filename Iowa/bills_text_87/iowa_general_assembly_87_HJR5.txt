  2 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 16    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 17 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to the funding of
  2 18 the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund.
  2 19    A previous amendment to the Iowa Constitution ratified on
  2 20 November 2, 2010, created the natural resources and outdoor
  2 21 recreation trust fund (fund) and dedicated a portion of
  2 22 state tax revenues to the fund for the purposes of protecting
  2 23 and enhancing water quality and natural areas in the state
  2 24 including parks, trails, and fish and wildlife habitat, and
  2 25 conserving agricultural soils in the state.  Pursuant to the
  2 26 constitutional amendment, the amount credited to the fund
  2 27 will be equal to the amount generated by an increase in the
  2 28 state sales tax rate occurring after the effective date of the
  2 29 constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed the amount that
  2 30 a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would generate.  The
  2 31 state sales tax rate has not been increased since the effective
  2 32 date of the constitutional amendment, so no amounts have been
  2 33 credited to the fund.
  2 34    The joint resolution would strike the language dedicating
  2 35 to the fund a portion of the state tax revenues generated by
  3  1 an increase in the state sales tax rate and replace it with
  3  2 the requirement that the fund be credited with 3/40 of the
  3  3 state sales tax revenues that remain after any transfers of
  3  4 such state tax revenues required by law of this state in effect
  3  5 on the date of ratification of the amendment to local school
  3  6 districts to be used solely for school infrastructure purposes
  3  7 or school district property tax relief.  In other words, 3/40
  3  8 of the state sales tax revenues remaining after the transfers
  3  9 required to be made to the secure an advanced vision for
  3 10 education (SAVE) fund under Code chapter 423F (statewide school
  3 11 infrastructure funding), shall be credited to the fund.
  3 12    The joint resolution, if adopted, would be published and
  3 13 then referred to the next general assembly (Eighty=eighth)
  3 14 for adoption a second time, before being submitted to the
