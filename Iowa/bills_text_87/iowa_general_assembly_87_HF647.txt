 10  9                           EXPLANATION
 10 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 12    This bill relates to state finances, and includes findings.
 10 13 Current law requires certain revenues and other moneys to be
 10 14 deposited in or withdrawn from the general fund of the state
 10 15 (general fund) by certain state agencies, but does not dictate
 10 16 the day on which such deposits or withdrawals are made.  The
 10 17 bill provides a day or days on which certain deposits or
 10 18 withdrawals must be made.
 10 19    The bill provides that beer and liquor revenues and
 10 20 vintner's certificate and wine permit revenues required under
 10 21 Code section 123.17 to be transferred by the department of
 10 22 administrative services (DAS) from the beer and liquor control
 10 23 fund to the general fund shall be transferred monthly on the
 10 24 eighth day of the month, or the next succeeding business day if
 10 25 the eighth day falls on a weekend or holiday.  Transfers on any
 10 26 other day are prohibited unless the director of DAS determines
 10 27 extraordinary circumstances exist.
 10 28    The bill provides that deposits and credits by the
 10 29 department of revenue (DOR) of school district and emergency
 10 30 medical services income surtax revenues into the school
 10 31 district income surtax fund as required by Code section 298.14
 10 32 and the local income surtax fund as required by Code section
 10 33 422D.3 shall be made on the 20th day of a month, or the next
 10 34 succeeding business day if the 20th day falls on a weekend
 10 35 or holiday.  Deposits and credits shall not be made on any
 11  1 other day unless the director of DOR determines extraordinary
 11  2 circumstances exist.
 11  3    Current law in Code section 421.17 allows DOR to contract
 11  4 with third=party vendors for the collection of taxes and other
 11  5 amounts, and from those collections current law provides for
 11  6 several appropriations to DOR of amounts sufficient to pay
 11  7 for the third=party vendor services.  The bill provides that
 11  8 transfers or remittances from the general fund for the payment
 11  9 of the services shall be made on the 20th day of the month,
 11 10 or the next succeeding business day if the 20th day falls on
 11 11 a weekend or holiday.  Transfers shall not be made on any
 11 12 other day unless the director of DOR determines extraordinary
 11 13 circumstances exist.

 11 15 general fund to the workforce development fund account
 11 16 established in Code section 15.342A shall be credited on

 11 18 next succeeding business day if one of those days falls on
 11 19 a weekend or holiday.  The director of DOR shall not credit
 11 20 amounts on any other day unless the director of DOR determines
 11 21 extraordinary circumstances exist.
 11 22    The bill provides that sales and use tax revenues received
 11 23 by DOR for deposit in the general fund shall be transmitted
 11 24 daily to the treasurer of state for such deposit, and further
 11 25 provides that sales and use tax deposit amounts that are timely
 11 26 paid by taxpayers to DOR shall be transmitted by DOR to the
 11 27 treasurer of state no later than one business day following the
 11 28 due date of the deposit amount.
 11 29    Current law in Code section 423.3(11)(b) provides for
 11 30 several transfers of sales and use tax revenues by DOR from
 11 31 the general fund to various other funds for various purposes,
 11 32 including a local option sales tax fund, the natural resources
 11 33 and outdoor recreation trust fund, the secure an advanced
 11 34 vision for education fund, a baseball and softball complex
 11 35 sales tax rebate fund, a reinvestment district fund, a flood
 12  1 mitigation program fund, and a raceway facility tax rebate
 12  2 fund.  The bill provides that these transfers shall be made on
 12  3 the 20th day of the month, or on the next succeeding business
 12  4 day if the 20th day falls on a weekend or holiday.  Transfers
 12  5 shall not be made on any other day unless the director of DOR
 12  6 determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 12  7    Current law in Code section 423A.6 provides for several
 12  8 transfers of hotel and motel tax revenues by DOR from the
 12  9 general fund to various other funds for various purposes,
 12 10 including a reinvestment district fund and a local hotel and
 12 11 motel tax fund.  The bill provides that these transfers shall
 12 12 be made on the 20th day of the month, or on the next succeeding
 12 13 business day if the 20th day falls on a weekend or holiday.
 12 14 Transfers shall not be made on any other day unless the
 12 15 director of DOR determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 12 16    Current law in Code section 556.18 requires the treasurer
 12 17 of state to transfer unclaimed property funds received by the
 12 18 treasurer quarterly to the general fund.  The bill requires
 12 19 such transfers to be made four times per year on October 20,
 12 20 December 20, March 20, and June 20, or on the next succeeding
 12 21 business day if one of those dates falls on a weekend or
 12 22 holiday.  Transfers shall not be made on any other day unless
 12 23 the treasurer of state determines extraordinary circumstances
 12 24 exist.  Current law further provides that certain unclaimed
 12 25 deposits and refunds held by utilities shall be annually
 12 26 credited by the treasurer of state to the general fund.  The
 12 27 bill requires such annual credits to be made on January 20,
 12 28 or on the next succeeding business day if January 20 falls
 12 29 on a weekend or holiday.  The treasurer of state shall not
 12 30 credit amounts on any other day unless the treasurer of state
 12 31 determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 12 32    Current law requires employers (withholding agents) to
 12 33 withhold income tax from employees and remit that tax to DOR
 12 34 at varying frequencies depending on the total amount withheld
 12 35 by the employer.  The bill requires a withholding agent that
 13  1 is a state agency or department and that withholds more than
 13  2 $5,000 from employees in a semimonthly period (semimonthly
 13  3 depositor) to deposit such required semimonthly deposit amounts
 13  4 with DOR on the 10th day and 25th day of the month, or on the
 13  5 next succeeding business day if such day falls on a weekend or
 13  6 holiday.  Such agencies or departments shall not deposit these
 13  7 withholding amounts on any other day unless the director of DOR
 13  8 determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 13  9    Furthermore, the bill requires withholding amounts that
 13 10 are timely paid by any withholding agent to be transmitted by
 13 11 DOR to the treasurer of state no later than one business day
 13 12 following the due date of the withholding amount.
 13 13    Finally, Code section 11.4 requires the auditor of state
 13 14 to file written reports following all audits and examinations
 13 15 and requires such reports to include certain information or
 13 16 opinions.  The bill adds a requirement that the auditor of
 13 17 state, when auditing or examining DOR or DAS, include in the
 13 18 report the auditor's opinion, after considering the best
 13 19 practices and long=term operations of each department, as to
 13 20 whether the pace at which certain tax refunds were processed
 13 21 and paid during a fiscal year by DOR was appropriate, and as
 13 22 to whether the fiscal year to which such refunds were accrued
 13 23 and attributed by DAS was appropriate, or whether a deviation
 13 24 from the best practices and long=term operations of one or
 13 25 more department exists.  If a deviation is found to exist, the
 13 26 auditor shall include the auditor's opinion, if any, as to the

 10 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 12    This bill relates to state finances, and includes findings.
 10 13 Current law requires certain revenues and other moneys to be
 10 14 deposited in or withdrawn from the general fund of the state
 10 15 (general fund) by certain state agencies, but does not dictate
 10 16 the day on which such deposits or withdrawals are made.  The
 10 17 bill provides a day or days on which certain deposits or
 10 18 withdrawals must be made.
 10 19    The bill provides that beer and liquor revenues and
 10 20 vintner's certificate and wine permit revenues required under
 10 21 Code section 123.17 to be transferred by the department of
 10 22 administrative services (DAS) from the beer and liquor control
 10 23 fund to the general fund shall be transferred monthly on the
 10 24 eighth day of the month, or the next succeeding business day if
 10 25 the eighth day falls on a weekend or holiday.  Transfers on any

 10 27 extraordinary circumstances exist.
 10 28    The bill provides that deposits and credits by the
 10 29 department of revenue (DOR) of school district and emergency
 10 30 medical services income surtax revenues into the school
 10 31 district income surtax fund as required by Code section 298.14
 10 32 and the local income surtax fund as required by Code section
 10 33 422D.3 shall be made on the 20th day of a month, or the next
 10 34 succeeding business day if the 20th day falls on a weekend
 10 35 or holiday.  Deposits and credits shall not be made on any
 11  1 other day unless the director of DOR determines extraordinary
 11  2 circumstances exist.
 11  3    Current law in Code section 421.17 allows DOR to contract
 11  4 with third=party vendors for the collection of taxes and other
 11  5 amounts, and from those collections current law provides for
 11  6 several appropriations to DOR of amounts sufficient to pay
 11  7 for the third=party vendor services.  The bill provides that
 11  8 transfers or remittances from the general fund for the payment
 11  9 of the services shall be made on the 20th day of the month,
 11 10 or the next succeeding business day if the 20th day falls on
 11 11 a weekend or holiday.  Transfers shall not be made on any

 11 15 general fund to the workforce development fund account
 11 16 established in Code section 15.342A shall be credited on
 11 17 October 20, December 20, March 20, and June 20, or on the
 11 18 next succeeding business day if one of those days falls on
 11 19 a weekend or holiday.  The director of DOR shall not credit
 11 20 amounts on any other day unless the director of DOR determines
 11 21 extraordinary circumstances exist.
 11 22    The bill provides that sales and use tax revenues received
 11 23 by DOR for deposit in the general fund shall be transmitted
 11 24 daily to the treasurer of state for such deposit, and further
 11 25 provides that sales and use tax deposit amounts that are timely
 11 26 paid by taxpayers to DOR shall be transmitted by DOR to the
 11 27 treasurer of state no later than one business day following the
 11 28 due date of the deposit amount.
 11 29    Current law in Code section 423.3(11)(b) provides for
 11 30 several transfers of sales and use tax revenues by DOR from
 11 31 the general fund to various other funds for various purposes,
 11 32 including a local option sales tax fund, the natural resources
 11 33 and outdoor recreation trust fund, the secure an advanced
 11 34 vision for education fund, a baseball and softball complex
 11 35 sales tax rebate fund, a reinvestment district fund, a flood
 12  1 mitigation program fund, and a raceway facility tax rebate
 12  2 fund.  The bill provides that these transfers shall be made on
 12  3 the 20th day of the month, or on the next succeeding business
 12  4 day if the 20th day falls on a weekend or holiday.  Transfers
 12  5 shall not be made on any other day unless the director of DOR
 12  6 determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 12  7    Current law in Code section 423A.6 provides for several
 12  8 transfers of hotel and motel tax revenues by DOR from the
 12  9 general fund to various other funds for various purposes,
 12 10 including a reinvestment district fund and a local hotel and
 12 11 motel tax fund.  The bill provides that these transfers shall
 12 12 be made on the 20th day of the month, or on the next succeeding
 12 13 business day if the 20th day falls on a weekend or holiday.
 12 14 Transfers shall not be made on any other day unless the
 12 15 director of DOR determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 12 16    Current law in Code section 556.18 requires the treasurer
 12 17 of state to transfer unclaimed property funds received by the
 12 18 treasurer quarterly to the general fund.  The bill requires
 12 19 such transfers to be made four times per year on October 20,
 12 20 December 20, March 20, and June 20, or on the next succeeding
 12 21 business day if one of those dates falls on a weekend or
 12 22 holiday.  Transfers shall not be made on any other day unless
 12 23 the treasurer of state determines extraordinary circumstances
 12 24 exist.  Current law further provides that certain unclaimed
 12 25 deposits and refunds held by utilities shall be annually
 12 26 credited by the treasurer of state to the general fund.  The
 12 27 bill requires such annual credits to be made on January 20,
 12 28 or on the next succeeding business day if January 20 falls
 12 29 on a weekend or holiday.  The treasurer of state shall not
 12 30 credit amounts on any other day unless the treasurer of state
 12 31 determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 12 32    Current law requires employers (withholding agents) to
 12 33 withhold income tax from employees and remit that tax to DOR
 12 34 at varying frequencies depending on the total amount withheld
 12 35 by the employer.  The bill requires a withholding agent that
 13  1 is a state agency or department and that withholds more than
 13  2 $5,000 from employees in a semimonthly period (semimonthly
 13  3 depositor) to deposit such required semimonthly deposit amounts
 13  4 with DOR on the 10th day and 25th day of the month, or on the
 13  5 next succeeding business day if such day falls on a weekend or
 13  6 holiday.  Such agencies or departments shall not deposit these
 13  7 withholding amounts on any other day unless the director of DOR
 13  8 determines extraordinary circumstances exist.
 13  9    Furthermore, the bill requires withholding amounts that
 13 10 are timely paid by any withholding agent to be transmitted by
 13 11 DOR to the treasurer of state no later than one business day
 13 12 following the due date of the withholding amount.
 13 13    Finally, Code section 11.4 requires the auditor of state
 13 14 to file written reports following all audits and examinations
 13 15 and requires such reports to include certain information or
 13 16 opinions.  The bill adds a requirement that the auditor of
 13 17 state, when auditing or examining DOR or DAS, include in the
 13 18 report the auditor's opinion, after considering the best
 13 19 practices and long=term operations of each department, as to
 13 20 whether the pace at which certain tax refunds were processed
 13 21 and paid during a fiscal year by DOR was appropriate, and as
 13 22 to whether the fiscal year to which such refunds were accrued
 13 23 and attributed by DAS was appropriate, or whether a deviation
 13 24 from the best practices and long=term operations of one or
 13 25 more department exists.  If a deviation is found to exist, the
 13 26 auditor shall include the auditor's opinion, if any, as to the
 13 27 reason for the deviation.
