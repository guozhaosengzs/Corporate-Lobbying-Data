  7 29 monitor the legal and economic impacts of trade agreements on
  7 30 state laws and local ordinances, working conditions, and the
  7 31 state's natural resources, communities, and economy, and to
  7 32 provide a mechanism for citizens and members of the general
  7 33 assembly to voice their concerns and recommendations. The
  7 34 council is required to consist of 10 public members appointed

  8  9 and the compensation and terms of members.
  8 10    Under the bill, the governor, the majority leader of the
  8 11 senate, and the speaker of the house of representatives
  8 12 are each required to designate one of the public members to
  8 13 jointly serve as co=chairpersons. The bill allows the council
  8 14 to appoint other officers and committees as necessary and
  8 15 requires that the general assembly, through the legislative
  8 16 council, contract for staff support for the council. The
  8 17 support is required to be full=time if funding permits, but if
  8 18 funding does not permit adequate staff support, the council
  8 19 is permitted to request staff support from the legislative
  8 20 services agency and the economic development authority. The
  8 21 bill provides the council with a standing appropriation
  8 22 of $10,000, every other fiscal year, for the production of
  8 23 reports.
  8 24    Under the bill, the council is required to meet at least

  9  3 conduct an evaluation of its activities and recommend to the
  9  4 general assembly, by December 31, 2023, whether to continue,
  9  5 alter, or cease the council's activities.
  9  6    The bill also allows the council to maintain active
  9  7 communications with any entity the council determines
  9  8 appropriate, recommend or submit legislation to the general
  9  9 assembly, recommend that the state support, or withhold its
  9 10 support from, future trade negotiations or agreements, and
  9 11 to examine any aspects of international trade, international
  9 12 economic integration, and trade agreements that the members of
  9 13 the council consider appropriate.
  9 14    The bill creates a fund in the office of the treasurer
  9 15 of state under the control of the council to receive moneys
  9 16 appropriated by the general assembly and from any other
  9 17 source. Under the bill, moneys in the fund are appropriated
  9 18 to the council and the treasurer of state is required to act
  9 19 as custodian of the fund and disburse moneys contained in the
  9 20 fund as directed by the council. The council is required to
  9 21 annually notify the legislative council of any solicitation or

  9 23 are not subject to reversion under Code section 8.33 and any
  9 24 interest or earnings on moneys in the fund are required to be
  9 25 credited to the fund.
  9 26    The bill provides that an official of the state, including
  9 27 the governor, is not able to give consent to bind the state
  9 28 to the terms or provisions of a trade agreement unless the
  9 29 general assembly has passed a joint resolution authorizing the
  9 30 governor or other official of the state to bind the state to
  9 31 the trade agreement or to a designated provision within the
  9 32 trade agreement.
  9 33    Under the bill, the governor is required to transmit a
  9 34 copy of a trade agreement, or relevant provisions of a trade
  9 35 agreement, to the co=chairpersons of the council, the president
 10  1 of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, and
 10  2 the chairpersons and ranking members of the general assembly's
 10  3 standing committees on economic growth.
 10  4    The bill requires that the council, in consultation with
 10  5 the authority, the attorney general, and the faculty of the
 10  6 international and comparative law program at the college of
 10  7 law at the university of Iowa, immediately review, analyze,
