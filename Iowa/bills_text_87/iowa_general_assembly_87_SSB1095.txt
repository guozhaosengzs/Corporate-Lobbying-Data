that

The

Until

incurred
by
a
5


corporation
as
the
result
of
a
merger
or
consolidation.
The
6


bill
provides
that
the
cumulative
successor
asbestos-related
7


liabilities
of
a
successor
corporation
are
limited
to
the
8


fair
market
value
of
the
total
gross
assets
of
the
transferor
9


determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
merger
or
consolidation.
10


The
fair
market
value
of
the
total
gross
assets
may
be
11


determined
by
any
method
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
12


including
by
reference
to
the
going
concern
value
of
the
assets
13


or
to
the
purchase
price
attributable
to
or
paid
for
the
assets
14


in
an
arms-length
transaction,
or,
in
the
absence
of
other
15


readily
available
information
from
which
the
fair
market
value
16


can
be
determined,
by
reference
to
the
value
of
the
assets
17


recorded
on
a
balance
sheet.
18


The
bill
provides
that
the
fair
market
value
of
total
gross
19


assets
shall
increase
annually
at
a
rate
equal
to
the
sum
of
20


the
prime
rate
plus
1
percent.
21


The
bill
is
to
be
liberally
construed
with
regard
to
22


successor
corporations.
23


The
bill
applies
to
all
asbestos
and
silica
actions
24


filed
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill,
and
to
all
25


pending
asbestos
and
silica
actions
in
which
trial
has
not
26


commenced
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
bill
unless
the
court


27


finds
that
the
application
of
a
provision
in
the
bill
would
28


unconstitutionally
affect
a
vested
right.
In
that
case,
the
29


provision
does
not
apply
and
the
court
shall
apply
prior
law.
