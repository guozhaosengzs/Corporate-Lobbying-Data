The
bill
establishes
a
methodology
for
establishing
a
4


regional
per
capita
expenditure
target
amount.
For
a
region
5


comprised
of
one
county
with
a
population
of
400,000
or
over,
6


for
the
fiscal
year
beginning
July
1,
2017,
the
regional
per
7


capita
expenditure
target
amount
is
$45.
For
the
fiscal
year
8


beginning
July
1,
2017,
for
all
other
regions
the
regional
9


per
capita
expenditure
target
amount
is
the
sum
of
the
base
10


expenditure
amount
for
all
counties
in
the
region,
divided
11


by
the
population
of
the
region.
The
bill
defines
“base
12


expenditure
amount”
as
the
lesser
of
either
the
county’s
13


base
year
expenditures
for
mental
health
and
disabilities
14


services,
as
defined
in
section
331.424A,
Code
2017,
or
the
15


product
of
$47.28
multiplied
by
the
county’s
population
for
16


the
fiscal
year
beginning
July
1,
2017.
For
the
fiscal
year
17


beginning
July
1,
2018,
and
each
subsequent
fiscal
year,
the
18


regional
per

expenditure
target
amount
is
an
amount
19


equal
to
the
regional
per
capita
expenditure
target
amount
20


for
the
immediately
preceding
fiscal
year
multiplied
by
the
21


annual
inflation
factor
for
the
fiscal
year,
as
specified
in
22


the
bill.
However,
the
bill
prohibits
the
application
of
the
23


annual
inflation
factor
from
resulting
in
a
regional
per
capita
24


expenditure
target
amount
that
exceeds
the
statewide
per
capita
25


expenditure
target
amount.
26


Under
the
bill,
a
county
is
required
to
certify
a
property
27


tax
levy
for
payment
of
services
in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
the
28


county
budgeted
amount
for
the
fiscal
year.
For
the
fiscal
29


year
beginning
July
1,
2017,
and
subsequent
fiscal
years,
30


each
county’s
budgeted
amount
shall
be
the
amount
necessary
31


to
meet
the
county’s
financial
obligations
for
the
payment
of
32


services
under
the
regional
service
system
management
plan,
not
33


to
exceed
an

equal

Under

is
also
used
to

reduce
the

For
each
county
located
in

region
with
a
population
14


of
100,000
or
over,
the
county’s
cash

15


equals

For

However,

the
