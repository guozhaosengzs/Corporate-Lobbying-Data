  6  6 monitored. The data shall be assessed and the department
  6  7 shall make a determination as to whether the stated goals of
  6  8 the alteration or modification were achieved and whether the
  6  9 alteration or modification should be formally implemented into
  6 10 the program.

  3 17    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
  3 18 immediate sanction can be effectively applied.
  3 19    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) creates a

  5  6 testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  5  7    (b)  The participant's employment requires the participant's
  5  8 presence at a location remote from the testing location and
  5  9 submitting to testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.

  4 35 and costs associated with the testing device.
  5  1    (3)  Whether the participant is capable of wearing the
  5  2 testing device.
  5  3    (4)  Whether the participant fails to qualify for testing
  5  4 twice per day because of one or more of the following:
  5  5    (a)  The participant lives in a rural area and submitting to
  5  6 testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  5  7    (b)  The participant's employment requires the participant's
  5  8 presence at a location remote from the testing location and
  5  9 submitting to testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  5 10    (c)  The participant has repeatedly violated the
  5 11 requirements of the program while submitting to testing twice
  5 12 per day and poses a substantial risk of continuing to violate
  5 13 the requirements of the program.

 33 13     33 12 the following new subsection:
 33 13     33 13     33 14 of a licensee or permittee shall complete or re=complete the
 33 15 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 33 16 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee
 33 17 or permittee is convicted of a violation of section 123.49,
 33 18 subsection 1 or 1A.  The employee or prospective employee shall
 33 19 attend the next available alcohol compliance employee training
 33 20 program taking place within one hundred miles of the licensee's
 33 21 or permittee's business.
 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87

 33 15 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 33 16 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee
 33 17 or permittee is convicted of a violation of section 123.49,
 33 18 subsection 1 or 1A.  The employee or prospective employee shall
 33 19 attend the next available alcohol compliance employee training
 33 20 program taking place within one hundred miles of the licensee's
 33 21 or permittee's business.
 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 16 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee
 33 17 or permittee is convicted of a violation of section 123.49,
 33 18 subsection 1 or 1A.  The employee or prospective employee shall
 33 19 attend the next available alcohol compliance employee training
 33 20 program taking place within one hundred miles of the licensee's
 33 21 or permittee's business.
 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 17 or permittee is convicted of a violation of section 123.49,
 33 18 subsection 1 or 1A.  The employee or prospective employee shall
 33 19 attend the next available alcohol compliance employee training
 33 20 program taking place within one hundred miles of the licensee's
 33 21 or permittee's business.
 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 18 subsection 1 or 1A.  The employee or prospective employee shall
 33 19 attend the next available alcohol compliance employee training
 33 20 program taking place within one hundred miles of the licensee's
 33 21 or permittee's business.
 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 19 attend the next available alcohol compliance employee training
 33 20 program taking place within one hundred miles of the licensee's
 33 21 or permittee's business.
 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87

 33 20 program taking place within one hundred miles of the licensee's
 33 21 or permittee's business.
 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 33 22                           EXPLANATION
 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the

 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 33 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 33 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 33 25    DIVISION I ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 26 PROGRAM.  This bill directs the department of public safety
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

       ns/rh
 33 27 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 33 28 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 29 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 30 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 31 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 32 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

       ns/rh
 33 33 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 33 34 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,

 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 33 35 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34  1 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 34  2 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34  3 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the

 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

       ns/rh
 34  4 including but not limited to a first or subsequent offense of
 34  5 operating while intoxicated (OWI).
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34  6    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34  7 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 34  8 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place

 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34  9 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 10 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 34 11 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place

 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 12    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 13 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 34 14 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 15 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 16 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 17 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 18 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 19 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 20 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 21 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 22    The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 23 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 24 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 25 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 26 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 27 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 28 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

       ns/rh
 34 29 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 30 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 31 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 32    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy

 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 34 33 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 34 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 34 35 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35  1 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35  2    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 35  3 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35  4 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35  5 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the

 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while

 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

       ns/rh
 35  6 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 35  7 initiated and monitored.
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 35  8    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 35  9 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of

 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required

 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the

 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.
       LSB 1244YH (7) 87
       ns/rh
 35 10 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 11 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 12 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 13 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 14 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 15 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 35 16 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of

 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with

 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's

 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as

 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 17 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 35 18 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee

 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

       ns/rh
 35 19 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while

 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon

 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a

 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 20 including all costs to the state.
 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 21    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 22 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 35 23 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the

 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating

 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second

 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 24 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 35 25 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two

 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to

 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 26 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 35 27 the data management system.
 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the

 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a

 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,

 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 28    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 35 29 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the

 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or

 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 30 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 35 31 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's

 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 32 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 35 33 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person

 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to

 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 35 34 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 35 35 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's

 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36  1 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 36  2 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense

 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36  3 program and payment of the required fees.
 36  4    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second

 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36  5 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 36  6 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear

 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense

 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36  7 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 36  8 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.

 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years

 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded

 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at

 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to

 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while

 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock

 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the

 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36  9 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 36 10 participant's information into the data management system. The
 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a

 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be

 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded

 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at

 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture

 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while

 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition

 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an

 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 11 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 36 12 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person

 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 13 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 14 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 15 participant with information related to the required testing,
 36 16 procedures, and fees.
 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device

 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture

 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition

 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent

 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally

 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 17    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 36 18 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 36 19 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).

 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition

 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent

 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code

 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 20 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC

 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a

 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or

 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 21 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 36 22 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the

 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 23 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 36 24 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second

 36 25 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 36 26 the program.
 36 27    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 36 28 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second

 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 29 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 36 30 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded

 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to

 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while

 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon

 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys

 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or

 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 31 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee

 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 36 32 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 36 33 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second

 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place

 36 34 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 36 35 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 37  1 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded

 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person

 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to

 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee

 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37  2 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 37  3 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be

 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37  4 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 37  5    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 37  6 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another

 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or

 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded

 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's

 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a

 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases

 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 37  7 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 37  8 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place

 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be

 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded

 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture

 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to

 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while

 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition

 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock

 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally

 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37  9 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 37 10 suspension or revocation period.
 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC

 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee

 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 37 11    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 37 12 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 37 13 recommendations by December 1, 2021.
 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not

 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or

 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The

 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at

 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to

 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while

 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while

 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock

 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the

 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle

 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 14    DIVISION II ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED.  The bill
 37 15 increases the look=back period for determining whether an
 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less

 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 16 OWI offense is a first or a subsequent offense from 12 years
 37 17 to 25 years. In addition, the bill requires an emblem to be
 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 18 displayed on the back of a person's driver's license if the
 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or

 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 19 person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the
 37 20 person's driver's license revoked under Code chapter 321J.
 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,

 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee

 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 37 21    For a first offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's
 37 22 license revocation period from 180 days to one year if the
 37 23 person submitted to a chemical test, and from one year to two
 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated

 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 37 24 years if the person refused a chemical test. For a second
 37 25 offense of OWI, the bill increases the driver's license
 37 26 revocation period from one year to two years if the person
 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 37 27 submitted to a chemical test, and from two years to four years
 37 28 if the person refused the chemical test. For a third offense
 37 29 of OWI, the bill strikes the driver's license revocation period
 37 30 of six years, requires the DOT to revoke a person's driver's
 37 31 license permanently, and provides that such a person is not
 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while

 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.

 37 32 eligible for a temporary restricted license. If a person
 37 33 guilty of any OWI offense seriously injures or kills another
 37 34 person, the bill also requires the DOT to revoke the person's
 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee

 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally

 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 37 35 driver's license permanently and provides that such a person is
 38  1 not eligible for a temporary restricted license.
 38  2    Under Code section 321J.4B (motor vehicle impoundment or
 38  3 immobilization), the bill removes from the definition of
 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an

 38  4 "immobilized" the installation of an ignition interlock device
 38  5 of a type approved by the commissioner of public safety. The
 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 38  6 bill increases the penalty for an owner of a vehicle impounded
 38  7 or immobilized, who knows of, should have known of, or gives
 38  8 consent to the operation of the vehicle by a person with a
 38  9 revoked driver's license due to an OWI violation from a simple
 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,

 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available

 38 10 misdemeanor to a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor
 38 11 is punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at
 38 12 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875. The bill also increases
 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,

 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an

 38 13 the minimum period of impoundment or immobilization from 180
 38 14 days to one year. In addition, the bill provides that a person
 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,

 38 15 who operates a vehicle with a revoked driver's license due to
 38 16 a second or subsequent OWI violation must have the person's
 38 17 vehicle seized and forfeited to the state. The bill also
 38 18 updates certain references in Code chapter 809A (forfeiture
 38 19 reform Act).
 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place

 38 20    Under current law, a preliminary screening test is
 38 21 prohibited from being used in any court action except to
 38 22 prove that a chemical test was properly requested of a person
 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,

 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a

 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon

 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition

 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 38 23 pursuant to Code chapter 321J.  The bill specifies that the
 38 24 results of a breath test administered after a preliminary
 38 25 screening test by a certified operator using a portable breath
 38 26 testing instrument may be used as evidence in any court action.
 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.

 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority

 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or

 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with

 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition

 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock

 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.

 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to

 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code
 40 31 section 811.1.
 40 32    DIVISION III == PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
 40 33 BEVERAGES.  The bill prohibits a person holding a liquor
 40 34 control license or wine or beer permit (licensee or permittee)
 40 35 for on=premises consumption from selling, dispensing, or giving
 41  1 another person any alcoholic liquor, wine, or beer, if the
 41  2 person's driver's license is marked to reflect that the person
 41  3 has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had the person's
 41  4 driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation. By operation
 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
 41  7 or permit of the licensee or permittee under Code section
 41  8 321.50, and may result in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41  9    The bill requires a licensee or permittee with an employee
 41 10 who has served alcohol to an intoxicated person in violation
 41 11 of Code section 321.49 to submit to the alcoholic beverages
 41 12 division of the department of commerce or a local authority
 41 13 a plan and procedure for the licensee or permittee to obtain
 41 14 transportation for intoxicated persons on the premises of a
 41 15 licensee's or permittee's business from the business to the
 41 16 intoxicated person's home. Failure to submit such a plan
 41 17 and procedure to the satisfaction of the division or local
 41 18 authority is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
 41 19 license or permit of the licensee or permittee, and may result
 41 20 in a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
 41 21    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
 41 22 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
 41 23 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
 41 24 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
 41 25 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
 41 26 person or to a person with a driver's license marked to reflect
 41 27 that the person has been convicted of an OWI offense or has had
 41 28 the person's driver's license revoked due to an OWI violation.
 41 29 The bill requires the person to attend the next available
 41 30 alcohol compliance employee training program taking place
 41 31 within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's business.

 38 27    Current law provides for an expedited warrant procedure to
 38 28 withdrawal a specimen of breath, urine, or blood for chemical
 38 29 testing from a person involved in a traffic accident that
 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device

 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code

 38 30 has resulted in a death or personal injury reasonably likely
 38 31 to cause death, and there are reasonable grounds to believe
 38 32 that one or more persons whose driving may have been the
 38 33 proximate cause of the accident were operating a vehicle while
 38 34 intoxicated. The bill applies the expedited warrant procedure
 38 35 to any person who refuses a chemical test where the officer
 39  1 has reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating a
 39  2 vehicle while intoxicated.
 39  3    Current law requires a person guilty of operating while
 39  4 intoxicated (OWI) to install an ignition interlock device in
 39  5 the person's vehicle if the person seeks a temporary restricted
 39  6 license, unless the person's alcohol concentration was less
 39  7 than .10 and no accident occurred. This bill strikes that
 39  8 exception, and also requires a person guilty of OWI to install
 39  9 an ignition interlock device in the person's vehicle upon the
 39 10 revocation of the person's driver's license rather than upon
 39 11 the person's application for a temporary restricted license.
 39 12    Under current law, an ignition interlock device is required
 39 13 to be installed in a person's vehicle for the period of time
 39 14 for which the person's temporary restricted license is issued,
 39 15 and up to one additional year after license reinstatement
 39 16 if the person has two or more OWI revocations. The bill
 39 17 requires the permanent installation of an ignition interlock
 39 18 device with one exception. If an ignition interlock device
 39 19 was installed in a vehicle as a result of a person's first
 39 20 OWI offense or revocation, the device must be uninstalled two
 39 21 years after the date the person's driver's license revocation
 39 22 period ends, 180 days after the date the person last failed a
 39 23 test or retest by the device, or 180 days after the date the
 39 24 person last failed to maintain the device as required under DPS
 39 25 rules, whichever is later. However, the bill provides that an
 39 26 ignition interlock device installed in a vehicle must not be
 39 27 uninstalled if the person has been convicted of tampering with
 39 28 or circumventing an ignition interlock device.
 39 29    The bill provides that a test failure using an ignition
 39 30 interlock device must be reported by the device or an entity
 39 31 monitoring the device to the DOT.  The bill also provides that
 39 32 upon revocation, and at such times as the DOT may require, a
 39 33 person must certify to the DOT that the person has installed
 39 34 an ignition interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated
 39 35 by the person.
 40  1 The bill requires the DOT to assess a monthly ignition
 40  2 interlock user fee to each user of an ignition interlock
 40  3 device. All ignition interlock user fees will be collected
 40  4 by the DOT and deposited in an ignition interlock indigent
 40  5 user fund (IIIUF). The bill requires the DOT to use the moneys
 40  6 in the IIIUF to assist indigent users of ignition interlock
 40  7 devices in paying for the use of the devices. The amount of
 40  8 the monthly ignition interlock user fee shall be set by the DOT
 40  9 so that the moneys in the IIIUF are sufficient to assist all
 40 10 indigent users of ignition interlock devices in paying for the
 40 11 use of the devices.
 40 12    Under the bill, a person is indigent if the person has an
 40 13 income level at or below 125 percent of the U.S. poverty level
 40 14 and the person is unable to pay for the cost of an ignition
 40 15 interlock device. A person is also indigent if the person has
 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
 40 18 interlock device would cause the person substantial hardship.
 40 19    The bill increases the punishment for a person who
 40 20 unintentionally causes the death of another person by operating
 40 21 a vehicle while intoxicated from up to 25 years in prison to
 40 22 up to 50 years in prison. In addition, the bill increases
 40 23 the punishment for a person who unintentionally causes
 40 24 serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle while
 40 25 intoxicated from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony. A
 40 26 class "C" felony is punishable by up to 10 years in prison
 40 27 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. By
 40 28 operation of law, this prohibits a person who unintentionally
 40 29 causes serious injury to another person by operating a vehicle
 40 30 while intoxicated from being admitted to bail under Code

 41  5 of law, a violation of this provision is a simple misdemeanor
 41  6 and is grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license

 40 16 an income level greater than 125 percent, but at or below 200
 40 17 percent, of the U.S. poverty level and paying for the ignition
