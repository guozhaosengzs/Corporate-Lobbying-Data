  3 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 30    This bill includes provisions relating to the rights of
  3 31 protection accorded each life and the prohibition against
  3 32 abortion, based on detection of a fetal heartbeat. The bill is
  3 33 organized into divisions.
  3 34    Division I provides for the recognition that each life
  3 35 begins at the moment the fetal heartbeat is detected, and that
  4  1 at that point is accorded the same rights and protections
  4  2 guaranteed to all persons by the Constitution of the United
  4  3 States, the Constitution of the State of Iowa, and the laws of
  4  4 this state. This provision is not to be construed to create or
  4  5 recognize a right to an abortion, to impose civil or criminal
  4  6 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed, or to
  4  7 prohibit the use of any means of contraception.
  4  8    Division II repeals or strikes and replaces portions of Code
  4  9 chapter 146B (abortion == limitations and prerequisites) which
  4 10 prohibits the abortion of an unborn child (defined in Code
  4 11 section 146B.1 as an individual organism of the species homo
  4 12 sapiens from fertilization until live birth) from 20 or more
  4 13 weeks postfertilization age, to instead prohibit an abortion
  4 14 from the time an unborn child has a detectable heartbeat.  The
  4 15 bill also provides definitions, provides for the manner in
  4 16 which a physician is to test for a detectable fetal heartbeat,
  4 17 requires written information to be provided to a pregnant woman
  4 18 following the testing for a fetal heartbeat, and requires that
  4 19 upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 20 shall sign a form acknowledging receipt of the information and
  4 21 a copy of the signed acknowledgment is to be included in the
  4 22 woman's medical record.
  4 23    The division prohibits a physician from performing or
  4 24 attempting to perform an abortion upon a pregnant woman when it
  4 25 has been determined, by the physician performing the abortion
  4 26 or by another physician upon whose determination that physician
  4 27 relies, that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat,
  4 28 unless, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, a
  4 29 medical emergency exists. Failure of a physician to comply
  4 30 with the division is grounds for licensee discipline under Code
  4 31 chapter 148 (medicine and surgery and osteopathic medicine
  4 32 and surgery). The division is not to be construed to create
  4 33 or recognize a right to an abortion; impose civil or criminal
  4 34 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed; or
  4 35 to prohibit the sale, use, prescription, or administration
  5  1 of a measure, drug, or chemical designed for the purposes of
  5  2 contraception. The board of medicine is required to adopt
  5  3 rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the provisions

  3 30    This bill includes provisions relating to the rights of
  3 31 protection accorded each life and the prohibition against
  3 32 abortion, based on detection of a fetal heartbeat. The bill is
  3 33 organized into divisions.
  3 34    Division I provides for the recognition that each life
  3 35 begins at the moment the fetal heartbeat is detected, and that
  4  1 at that point is accorded the same rights and protections
  4  2 guaranteed to all persons by the Constitution of the United

  4  7 prohibit the use of any means of contraception.

  4 12 sapiens from fertilization until live birth) from 20 or more
  4 13 weeks postfertilization age, to instead prohibit an abortion
  4 14 from the time an unborn child has a detectable heartbeat.  The
  4 15 bill also provides definitions, provides for the manner in
  4 16 which a physician is to test for a detectable fetal heartbeat,
  4 17 requires written information to be provided to a pregnant woman
  4 18 following the testing for a fetal heartbeat, and requires that

  4 20 shall sign a form acknowledging receipt of the information and
  4 21 a copy of the signed acknowledgment is to be included in the

  4 23    The division prohibits a physician from performing or
