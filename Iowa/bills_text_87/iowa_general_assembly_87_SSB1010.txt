In

,
an

4


arising

the
action
to
have
been
the
cause

death.
However,

subsection
does

bar
an

EXPLANATION
18


The

not
constitute
agreement
with
19


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
20


This
bill
relates
to
the
statute-of-repose
period
in
a
21


case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
defective
condition
of
an
22


improvement
to
real
property.
23


Under
current
law,
a
case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
24


defective
condition
of
an
improvement
to
real
property
is
25


subject
to
a
15-year
statute
of
repose.
Such
cases
are
based
26


upon
an
injury
to
property
or
an
injury
or
death
of
a
person.
27


The
bill

of
the
statute
of
repose
from

28


years
to

years.
29


A
statute-of-repose
period
differs
from
a
30


statute-of-limitations
period
in
that
a
statute
of
repose
31


establishes
a
time
period
after
which
a
lawsuit
based
upon
32


negligence
in
an
improvement
to
real
property
cannot
be
filed
33


regardless
of
whether
an
injury
to
a
person
or
to
property
has
34


occurred.
A
statute-of-limitations
period
begins
at
the
date
