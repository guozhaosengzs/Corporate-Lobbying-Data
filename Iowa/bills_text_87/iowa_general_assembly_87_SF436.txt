  1  1    Section 1.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The general assembly
  1  2 finds and declares the following:
  1  3    1.  Health carriers, health benefit plans, and utilization
  1  4 review organizations are increasingly making use of step
  1  5 therapy protocols under which covered persons are required to
  1  6 try one or more prescription drugs before coverage is provided
  1  7 for another prescription drug selected by the covered person's
  1  8 health care professional.
  1  9    2.  Such step therapy protocols, where they are based on
  1 10 well=developed scientific standards and administered in a
  1 11 flexible manner that takes into account the individual needs
  1 12 of covered persons, can play an important part in controlling
  1 13 health care costs.
  1 14    3.  In some cases, requiring a covered person to follow
  1 15 a step therapy protocol may have adverse and even dangerous
  1 16 consequences for the covered person, who may either not realize
  1 17 a benefit from taking a particular prescription drug or may
  1 18 suffer harm from taking an inappropriate prescription drug.
  1 19    4.  Without uniform policies in the state for step therapy
  1 20 protocols, all covered persons may not receive equivalent or
  1 21 the most appropriate treatment.
  1 22    5.  It is imperative that step therapy protocols in the state
  1 23 preserve the health care professional's right to make treatment
  1 24 decisions that are in the best interest of the covered person.
  1 25    6.  It is a matter of public interest that the general
  1 26 assembly require health carriers, health benefit plans, and
  1 27 utilization review organizations to base step therapy protocols
  1 28 on appropriate clinical practice guidelines or published peer
  1 29 review data developed by independent experts with knowledge

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.

  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the

  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily

  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily

  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination

  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3  8    j.  "Step therapy override exception" means a step therapy
  3  9 protocol should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier

  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified

 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and

 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier

  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 20 drugs and drugs administered by a health care professional.
  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an

  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,

  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or

  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.

  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are

  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3  9 protocol should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of
  3 10 the prescription drug selected by a health care professional.

  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee

  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3  8    j.  "Step therapy override exception" means a step therapy
  3  9 protocol should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of
  3 10 the prescription drug selected by a health care professional.
  3 11 This determination is based on a review of the covered person's
  3 12 or health care professional's request for an override, along
  3 13 with supporting rationale and documentation.
  3 14    k.  "Step therapy protocol" means a protocol or program that
  3 15 establishes a specific sequence in which prescription drugs for
  3 16 a specified medical condition and medically appropriate for
  3 17 a particular covered person are covered under a pharmacy or
  3 18 medical benefit by a health carrier, a health benefit plan, or
  3 19 a utilization review organization, including self=administered
  3 20 drugs and drugs administered by a health care professional.
  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier
  4  1 performing utilization review for its own health benefit plans.
  4  2    2.  Establishment of step therapy protocols.
  4  3    a.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  4 11 of experts that manages conflicts of interest among members
  4 12 of the panel's writing and review groups by doing all of the
  4 13 following:
  4 14    (i)  Requiring members to disclose any potential conflicts
  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use

 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is

  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 18 medical benefit by a health carrier, a health benefit plan, or
  3 19 a utilization review organization, including self=administered
  3 20 drugs and drugs administered by a health care professional.
  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier
  4  1 performing utilization review for its own health benefit plans.
  4  2    2.  Establishment of step therapy protocols.
  4  3    a.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4  4 review organization shall do all of the following when

  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.
  4 23    (iii)  Offering opportunities for public review and

  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a
  8  2 request for a step therapy override exception within five
  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 19 a utilization review organization, including self=administered
  3 20 drugs and drugs administered by a health care professional.
  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which

  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier
  4  1 performing utilization review for its own health benefit plans.

  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.
  4 23    (iii)  Offering opportunities for public review and

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination

  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a

 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and

 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review

  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

       av/nh
  3 11 This determination is based on a review of the covered person's
  3 12 or health care professional's request for an override, along
  3 13 with supporting rationale and documentation.
  3 14    k.  "Step therapy protocol" means a protocol or program that
  3 15 establishes a specific sequence in which prescription drugs for
  3 16 a specified medical condition and medically appropriate for
  3 17 a particular covered person are covered under a pharmacy or
  3 18 medical benefit by a health carrier, a health benefit plan, or
  3 19 a utilization review organization, including self=administered
  3 20 drugs and drugs administered by a health care professional.
  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier
  4  1 performing utilization review for its own health benefit plans.
  4  2    2.  Establishment of step therapy protocols.
  4  3    a.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4  4 review organization shall do all of the following when
  4  5 establishing a step therapy protocol:
  4  6    (1)  Use clinical review criteria based on clinical practice
  4  7 guidelines that meet all of the following requirements:
  4  8    (a)  Recommend that particular prescription drugs be taken
  4  9 in the specific sequence required by the step therapy protocol.
  4 10    (b)  Are developed and endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel
  4 11 of experts that manages conflicts of interest among members
  4 12 of the panel's writing and review groups by doing all of the
  4 13 following:
  4 14    (i)  Requiring members to disclose any potential conflicts
  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.
  4 23    (iii)  Offering opportunities for public review and
  4 24 comments.
  4 25    (c)  Are based on high=quality studies, research, and
  4 26 medical practice.
  4 27    (d)  Are created through an explicit and transparent process

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is

  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a
  8  2 request for a step therapy override exception within five
  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases
  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.
       LSB 2354SV (2) 87
       av/nh
  3 15 establishes a specific sequence in which prescription drugs for
  3 16 a specified medical condition and medically appropriate for
  3 17 a particular covered person are covered under a pharmacy or
  3 18 medical benefit by a health carrier, a health benefit plan, or
  3 19 a utilization review organization, including self=administered
  3 20 drugs and drugs administered by a health care professional.
  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or
  3 26 provider for a clarification, guarantee, or statement of an
  3 27 individual's health insurance coverage or benefits provided
  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier
  4  1 performing utilization review for its own health benefit plans.
  4  2    2.  Establishment of step therapy protocols.
  4  3    a.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4  4 review organization shall do all of the following when
  4  5 establishing a step therapy protocol:
  4  6    (1)  Use clinical review criteria based on clinical practice
  4  7 guidelines that meet all of the following requirements:
  4  8    (a)  Recommend that particular prescription drugs be taken
  4  9 in the specific sequence required by the step therapy protocol.
  4 10    (b)  Are developed and endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel
  4 11 of experts that manages conflicts of interest among members
  4 12 of the panel's writing and review groups by doing all of the
  4 13 following:
  4 14    (i)  Requiring members to disclose any potential conflicts
  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.
  4 23    (iii)  Offering opportunities for public review and
  4 24 comments.
  4 25    (c)  Are based on high=quality studies, research, and
  4 26 medical practice.
  4 27    (d)  Are created through an explicit and transparent process
  4 28 that does all of the following:
  4 29    (i)  Minimizes biases and conflicts of interest.
  4 30    (ii)  Explains the relationship between treatment options

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.

 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 19 a utilization review organization, including self=administered
  3 20 drugs and drugs administered by a health care professional.
  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or

  3 28 under a health benefit plan, nor to claims adjudication.
  3 29 Unless it is specifically stated, verification of benefits,
  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee
  3 32 or statement of insurance coverage or benefits for any
  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier

  4  7 guidelines that meet all of the following requirements:
  4  8    (a)  Recommend that particular prescription drugs be taken
  4  9 in the specific sequence required by the step therapy protocol.
  4 10    (b)  Are developed and endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel

  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and

  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the

  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific

 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 21    l.  "Utilization review" means a program or process by which
  3 22 an evaluation is made of the necessity, appropriateness, and
  3 23 efficiency of the use of health care services, procedures, or
  3 24 facilities given or proposed to be given to an individual.
  3 25 Such evaluation does not apply to requests by an individual or

  4  7 guidelines that meet all of the following requirements:
  4  8    (a)  Recommend that particular prescription drugs be taken
  4  9 in the specific sequence required by the step therapy protocol.
  4 10    (b)  Are developed and endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel
  4 11 of experts that manages conflicts of interest among members
  4 12 of the panel's writing and review groups by doing all of the
  4 13 following:
  4 14    (i)  Requiring members to disclose any potential conflicts
  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse

  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in

  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  3 populations and diagnoses when establishing clinical review
  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external

  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient

 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health

  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a

  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is

  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  4  4 review organization shall do all of the following when
  4  5 establishing a step therapy protocol:
  4  6    (1)  Use clinical review criteria based on clinical practice
  4  7 guidelines that meet all of the following requirements:
  4  8    (a)  Recommend that particular prescription drugs be taken
  4  9 in the specific sequence required by the step therapy protocol.
  4 10    (b)  Are developed and endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel
  4 11 of experts that manages conflicts of interest among members
  4 12 of the panel's writing and review groups by doing all of the
  4 13 following:
  4 14    (i)  Requiring members to disclose any potential conflicts
  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.
  4 23    (iii)  Offering opportunities for public review and
  4 24 comments.
  4 25    (c)  Are based on high=quality studies, research, and
  4 26 medical practice.
  4 27    (d)  Are created through an explicit and transparent process
  4 28 that does all of the following:
  4 29    (i)  Minimizes biases and conflicts of interest.

  5  1 evidence, research, and newly developed treatments.
  5  2    (2)  Take into account the needs of atypical covered person
  5  3 populations and diagnoses when establishing clinical review
  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical

 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular

 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient

 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  3 30 preauthorization, or a prospective or concurrent utilization
  3 31 review program or process shall not be construed as a guarantee

  3 33 individual under a health benefit plan.
  3 34    m.  "Utilization review organization" means an entity that
  3 35 performs utilization review, other than a health carrier
  4  1 performing utilization review for its own health benefit plans.

  4 11 of experts that manages conflicts of interest among members
  4 12 of the panel's writing and review groups by doing all of the
  4 13 following:
  4 14    (i)  Requiring members to disclose any potential conflicts
  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.
  4 23    (iii)  Offering opportunities for public review and
  4 24 comments.

  5  3 populations and diagnoses when establishing clinical review
  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  4 15 of interest with entities, including health carriers,
  4 16 health benefit plans, utilization review organizations, and
  4 17 pharmaceutical manufacturers, and requiring members to recuse
  4 18 themselves from voting if there is a conflict of interest.
  4 19    (ii)  Using a methodologist to work with the panel's writing
  4 20 groups to provide objectivity in data analysis and ranking of
  4 21 evidence through the preparation of evidence tables and by
  4 22 facilitating consensus.
  4 23    (iii)  Offering opportunities for public review and
  4 24 comments.
  4 25    (c)  Are based on high=quality studies, research, and

  5  4 criteria.
  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.

  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to

  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.

  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.

  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes

  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical

 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in

 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient

 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the

  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other

  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly

  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that

  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a
  8  2 request for a step therapy override exception within five
  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases
  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal

  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured

  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:

  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:

  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in

  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to

  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known

  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in

  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.

  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review

  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  9  4                           EXPLANATION

  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical

 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient

 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review

  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override

  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override

  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior

  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly

  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom

  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.

  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized

  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is

 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the

  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do

  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a
  8  2 request for a step therapy override exception within five
  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases
  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health

  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  5    (3)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1),  peer=reviewed
  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a
  8  2 request for a step therapy override exception within five
  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases
  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health

  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be

 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a

  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5  6 publications may be substituted for the use of clinical
  5  7 practice guidelines in establishing a step therapy protocol.
  5  8    b.  This subsection shall not be construed to require
  5  9 health carriers, health benefit plans, utilization review
  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be

 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours

 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 10 organizations, or the state to establish a new entity to
  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the

  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved

  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy

  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  8 27 either of the following:
  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 11 develop clinical review criteria for step therapy protocols.
  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a

  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases
  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific

 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step

 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is

  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 12    c.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5 13 review organization shall, upon written request of an insured
  5 14 or prospective insured, provide specific written clinical
  5 15 review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease,
  5 16 including clinical review criteria relating to a request for a
  5 17 step therapy override exception and, where appropriate, other
  5 18 clinical information which the health carrier, health benefit
  5 19 plan, or utilization review organization might consider in its
  5 20 utilization review or in making a determination to approve
  5 21 or deny a request for a step therapy override exception,
  5 22 including a description of how the information will be used in
  5 23 the utilization review process or in making a determination
  5 24 to approve or deny a request for a step therapy override
  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.
  6  1    3.  Exceptions process transparency.
  6  2    a.  When coverage of a prescription drug for the
  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  6  5 review organization through the use of a step therapy
  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on

 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,

  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.

  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is

  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known

  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent

  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a

  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior

  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent

  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 25 exception.  However, to the extent that such information is
  5 26 proprietary to the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  5 27 utilization review organization, the insured or prospective
  5 28 insured shall only use the information for the purposes of
  5 29 assisting the insured or prospective insured in evaluating the
  5 30 covered services provided by the health carrier, health benefit
  5 31 plan, or utilization review organization.  Such clinical review
  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  3 treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use
  6  4 by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  6 11 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  The process
  6 12 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  6 13 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,
  6 17 or utilization review organization if any of the following
  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the

  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  5 32 criteria and other clinical information shall also be made
  5 33 available to a health care professional, upon written request
  5 34 made by the health care professional on behalf of an insured
  5 35 or prospective insured.

  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily
  6  8 accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy
  6  9 override exception.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 10 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  6 14 organization.
  6 15    b.  A step therapy override exception shall be approved
  6 16 expeditiously by a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6  6 protocol, the covered person and the prescribing health
  6  7 care professional shall have access to a clear, readily

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6 18 circumstances apply:
  6 19    (1)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 20 protocol is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse
  6 21 reaction or physical or mental harm to the covered person.
  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known
  6 25 characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.
  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the

  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a

  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known
  6 24 clinical characteristics of the covered person and the known

  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the

  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current

  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the

  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  6 22    (2)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 23 protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known

  6 26    (3)  The covered person has tried the prescription drug
  6 27 required under the step therapy protocol while under the
  6 28 covered person's current or a previous health benefit plan,
  6 29 or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class
  6 30 or with the same mechanism of action, and such prescription
  6 31 drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness,
  6 32 diminished effect, or an adverse event.
  6 33    (4)  The prescription drug required under the step therapy
  6 34 protocol is not in the best interest of the covered person,
  6 35 based on medical necessity.
  7  1    (5)  The covered person is stable on a prescription drug
  7  2 selected by the covered person's health care professional for
  7  3 the medical condition under consideration while on the current
  7  4 or a previous health benefit plan.
  7  5    c.  Upon approval of a step therapy override exception, the
  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7  6 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7  7 organization shall expeditiously authorize coverage for the
  7  8 prescription drug selected by the covered person's prescribing
  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within
  7 13 five calendar days of receipt of the request for an exception
  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a
  8  2 request for a step therapy override exception within five
  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases
  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the

 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,

 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the

 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial

 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is

  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical

 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,

 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7  9 health care professional.
  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a

  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a

  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall

  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based

 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in

 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol

 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be

 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours

 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or

 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of

 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is

  8 28    a.  Prevent a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  8 29 utilization review organization from requiring a covered person
  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription
  8 32 drug.
  8 33    b.  Prevent a health care professional from prescribing
  8 34 a prescription drug that is determined to be medically
  8 35 appropriate.
  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7 10    d.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  7 11 review organization shall make a determination to approve or
  7 12 deny a request for a step therapy override exception within

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent
  7 15 circumstances exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 16 utilization review organization shall make a determination to
  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt
  7 19 of the request for an exception or appeal of a denial of such a
  7 20 request.  If a determination to approve or deny the request for
  7 21 an exception or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made
  7 22 within the applicable time period, the request for an exception
  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be
  7 24 approved.
  7 25    e.  If a determination is made to deny a request for
  7 26 a step therapy override exception, the health carrier,
  7 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization
  7 28 shall provide the covered person or the covered person's
  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered

  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a

  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are

  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step

 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are

  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in

 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol

 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient

 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with

 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health
  9  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7 14 or appeal of a denial of such a request.  In cases where exigent

  7 17 approve or deny the request for an exception or appeal of a
  7 18 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt

  7 23 or appeal of a denial of such a request shall be deemed to be

  7 29 authorized representative and the covered person's prescribing
  7 30 health care professional with the reason for the denial and
  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a

  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for

 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,

  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018.
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a

  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is

  9  1    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act is applicable to a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in

 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and

 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the

 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,

 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  7 31 information regarding the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
  7 32 determination to deny a request for a step therapy override
  7 33 exception may be appealed by a covered person or the covered
  7 34 person's authorized representative.
  7 35    f.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  8  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a denial of a
  8  2 request for a step therapy override exception within five
  8  3 calendar days of receipt of an appeal of the denial.  In cases
  8  4 where exigent circumstances exist as provided in paragraph "d",
  8  5 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  6 organization shall make a determination to uphold or reverse a
  8  7 denial of such a request within seventy=two hours of receipt of
  8  8 an appeal of the denial.  If the denial of a request for a step
  8  9 therapy override exception is not upheld or reversed on appeal
  8 10 within the applicable time period, the denial shall be deemed
  8 11 to be reversed and the request for an override exception shall
  8 12 be deemed to be approved.
  8 13    g.  If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
  8 14 exception is upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health
  8 15 benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  8 16 provide the covered person or the covered person's authorized
  8 17 representative and the patient's prescribing health care
  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external
  8 20 review of the denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a
  8 21 request for a step therapy override exception that is upheld
  8 22 on appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination
  8 23 for purposes of chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
  8 24 external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 25 authorized representative pursuant to chapter 514J.
  8 26    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do

  8 30 to try an AB=rated generic equivalent prescription drug prior
  8 31 to providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent

 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
 12  5 state on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 18 professional with the reason for upholding the denial on appeal
  8 19 and information regarding the procedure to request external

  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and

  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be

 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must

 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,

 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is

  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol

  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are

 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective

 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol

 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is
 12  4 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the

  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 31    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier,
 11 32 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization from
 11 33 requiring a person to try an AB=rated generic equivalent
 11 34 prescription drug prior to providing coverage for the
 11 35 equivalent branded prescription drug, or to prevent a health
 12  1 care professional from prescribing a prescription drug that is
 12  2 determined to be medically appropriate.
 12  3    The bill is applicable to a health benefit plan that is

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for

  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill relates to the use of step therapy protocols
  9  8 for prescription drugs by health carriers, health benefit
  9  9 plans, and utilization review organizations, and includes
  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

  9 10 applicability provisions.
  9 11    The bill includes legislative findings that step therapy
  9 12 protocols are increasingly being used by health carriers,
  9 13 health benefit plans, and utilization review organizations to
  9 14 control health care costs, that step therapy protocols that
  9 15 are based on well=developed scientific standards and flexibly
  9 16 administered can play an important role in controlling health
  9 17 care costs, but that in some cases use of such protocols can
  9 18 have adverse or dangerous consequences for the person for whom
  9 19 the drugs are prescribed.  The bill includes findings that
  9 20 uniform policies for the use of such protocols that preserve a
  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and
  9 27 medically appropriate for a particular covered person are
  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical
 10  1 populations and diagnoses.  The bill does not require a health
 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.
 10  5    Upon written request of an insured or prospective insured,
 10  6 or upon written request of a health care professional on behalf
 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific
 10  9 written clinical review criteria relating to a particular
 10 10 condition or disease, including criteria relating to a request
 10 11 for a step therapy override exception which might be used in
 10 12 utilization review or in making a determination to approve or
 10 13 deny a request for a step therapy override exception.  If the
 10 14 information provided is proprietary the insured or prospective
 10 15 insured shall use it only for purposes of evaluating covered
 10 16 services.
 10 17    The bill also provides that when a step therapy protocol
 10 18 is in use, the person participating in a health benefit plan
 10 19 or the person's prescribing health care professional must
 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug
 10 29 selected by the prescribing health care professional shall be
 10 30 authorized.
 10 31    A request for a step therapy override exception must be
 10 32 approved or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10 33 or utilization review organization utilizing the step therapy
 10 34 protocol within five calendar days of receipt of the request
 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the
 11  7 applicable time period, the request is deemed to be approved.
 11  8    If a determination is made to deny the request for a step
 11  9 therapy override exception, the health carrier, health benefit
 11 10 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide the
 11 11 person making the request with the reason for the denial and
 11 12 information about the procedure to appeal the denial.  Any
 11 13 denial of such a request is eligible for appeal.
 11 14    Upon appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
 11 15 utilization review organization shall make a determination
 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,
 11 17 or within 72 hours in the case of exigent circumstances, of
 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
 11 25 on appeal and information regarding the procedure to request
 11 26 external review of the denial pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
 11 27 A denial of a request for such an exception that is upheld on
 11 28 appeal shall be considered a final adverse determination for
 11 29 purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request for
 11 30 external review pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

  9 21 health care professional's right to make treatment decisions
  9 22 and that provide for exceptions to the use of such protocols
  9 23 are in the public interest.
  9 24    The bill defines a "step therapy protocol" as a protocol
  9 25 or program that establishes a specific sequence in which
  9 26 prescription drugs for a specified medical condition and

  9 28 covered under a pharmacy or medical benefit by a health
  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical

 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,
 10  3 or the state to establish a new entity to develop clinical
 10  4 review criteria for such protocols.

 10  7 of such a person, a health carrier, health benefit plan,
 10  8 or utilization review organization shall provide specific

 10 20 have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient
 10 21 process to request a step therapy override exception.  A "step
 10 22 therapy override exception" means a step therapy protocol
 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that
 10 27 the request for an exception shall be granted if specified
 10 28 circumstances are determined to exist and coverage for the drug

 10 35 or appeal of a denial of such a request, or within 72 hours
 11  1 of receipt of the request or appeal of a denial of such a
 11  2 request where exigent circumstances exist.  The health carrier,
 11  3 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization can
 11  4 use its existing medical exceptions procedure to satisfy this
 11  5 requirement.  If a determination to approve or deny the request
 11  6 or appeal of a denial of such a request is not made within the

 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,

  9 29 carrier, a health benefit plan, or a utilization review
  9 30 organization including self=administered drugs and drugs
  9 31 administered by a health care professional.
  9 32    The bill requires that a step therapy protocol be
  9 33 established using clinical review criteria that are based
  9 34 on specified clinical practice guidelines.  A step therapy
  9 35 protocol should take into account the needs of atypical

 10  2 carrier, health benefit plan, utilization review organization,

 10 23 should be overridden in favor of immediate coverage of the
 10 24 prescription drug selected by the prescribing health care
 10 25 professional, based on a review of the request along with
 10 26 supporting rationale and documentation.  The bill provides that

 11 16 to uphold or reverse the denial within five calendar days,

 11 18 receiving the appeal.  If the denial is not upheld or reversed
 11 19 on appeal within the applicable time period, the denial is
 11 20 deemed to be reversed and the request for an exception is
 11 21 deemed to be approved.
 11 22    If a denial of a request for a step therapy override
 11 23 exception is upheld on appeal, the person making the appeal
 11 24 shall be provided with the reason for upholding the denial
