S.F.

H.F.
_____


the
Code
chapters,
the
farm
mediation
service
conducts
the
1


mediation.
2


Mediation
is
a
method
for
parties
in
a
dispute
to
reach
3


an
accommodation
prior
to
instituting
a
legal
action.
If
an
4


accommodation
is
reached,
the
parties
execute
a
mediation
5


agreement.
If
an
accommodation
is
not
reached,
the
mediator
6


issues
a
mediation
release
which
allows
a
plaintiff
to
file
a
7


claim
for
relief
in
district
court.
In
the
instance
of
Code
8


chapter
654C,
legal
action
is
not
at
issue
because
mediation
is
9


initiated
by
the
agricultural
producer
to
obtain
a
waiver
of
a
10


statutory
requirement.
11


Under
current
law,
the
compensation
for
the
mediator
is
12


no
more
than
$25
per
hour,
and
all
parties
contribute
an
13


equal
amount
of
the
cost.
The
bill
raises
the
mediator’s
14


compensation
to
no
more
than
$100
per
hour.
15


The
bill
provides
that
the
farm
assistance
program
16


coordinator
may
adopt
rules
to
set
a
fee
for
filing
a
mediation
17


request
under
Code
section
654A.6
(mandatory
mediation
18


proceedings),
Code
section
654B.3
(mandatory
mediation
19


proceedings),
and
Code
section
654C.2
(mediation
proceedings).
20


The
filing
fee
cannot
exceed
$100,
and
may
be
waived
for
any
21


party
demonstrating
financial
hardship
to
the
farm
mediation
22


service.
23


Current
law
requires
that
the
farm
mediation
service,
after
24


receiving
a
mediation
request
for
a
dispute
between
a
creditor
25


and
a
farmer
who
is
a
borrower,
notify
the
borrower
that
legal
26


assistance
may
be
available
without
charge
through
the
legal
27


assistance
for
farmers
program
provided
in
Code
chapter
13.
28


The
bill
eliminates
this
requirement.
29


Code
chapter
654A
applies
to
a
borrower
operating
a
farm
30


who
is
a
natural
person,
corporation,
trust,
or
limited
31


partnership.
Code
chapter
654B
applies
to
farm
residents,
32


which
are
natural
persons,
corporations,
trusts,
or
limited
33


partnerships
holding
an
interest
in
farmland
and
managing
the
34


farming
operations
on
the
land.
