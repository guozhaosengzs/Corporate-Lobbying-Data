 14 25 chapter.  The bill requires 50 percent of the criminal penalty
 14 26 collected under this Code chapter to be deposited in a fund
 14 27 created in the bill. Moneys in the fund are appropriated to
 14 28 the insurance division of the department of commerce to the

 15 16 benefits under Code chapter 85, 85A, or 85B and the workers'
 15 17 compensation fraud unit makes a determination to file charges
 15 18 in district court alleging a violation of the new Code chapter
 15 19 by a person receiving benefits under Code chapter 85, 85A, or
 15 20 85B, the workers' compensation fraud unit shall notify the
 15 21 workers' compensation commissioner, who shall suspend benefits
