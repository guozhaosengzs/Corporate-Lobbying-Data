 14 26 The prima facie showing shall be made as to each defendant
 14 27 and include a detailed narrative medical report and diagnosis
 14 28 signed under oath by a qualified physician that includes all
 14 29 of the following:
 14 30    1.  Radiological or pathological evidence of asbestosis or
 14 31 radiological evidence of diffuse bilateral pleural thickening
 14 32 or a high=resolution computed tomography scan showing evidence
 14 33 of asbestosis or diffuse bilateral pleural thickening.
 14 34    2.  A detailed occupational and exposure history from
 14 35 the exposed person or, if that person is deceased, from the
 15  1 person most knowledgeable about the exposures that form the
 15  2 basis of the action, including identification of all of the
 15  3 exposed person's principal places of employment and exposures
 15  4 to airborne contaminants and whether each place of employment
 15  5 involved exposures to airborne contaminants, including asbestos
 15  6 fibers or other disease=causing dusts or fumes, that may cause
 15  7 pulmonary impairment and the nature, duration, and level of any
 15  8 exposure.
 15  9    3.  A detailed medical, social, and smoking history from the
 15 10 exposed person or, if that person is deceased, from the person
 15 11 most knowledgeable, including a thorough review of the past and
 15 12 present medical problems of the exposed person and the most
 15 13 probable cause of such medical problems.
 15 14    4.  Evidence verifying that at least fifteen years have
 15 15 elapsed between the exposed person's date of first exposure to
 15 16 asbestos and the date of diagnosis.
 15 17    5.  Evidence based upon a personal medical examination
 15 18 and pulmonary function testing of the exposed person or,
 15 19 if the exposed person is deceased, based upon the person's
 15 20 medical records, that the exposed person has or the deceased
 15 21 person had a permanent respiratory impairment rating of at
 15 22 least class 2 as defined by and evaluated pursuant to the
 15 23 AMA guides or reported significant changes year to year in
 15 24 lung function for FVC, FEV1, or diffusing capacity of the
 15 25 lung for carbon monoxide as defined by the American thoracic
 15 26 society's interpretative strategies for lung function tests, 26
 15 27 European Respiratory Journal 948=68, 961=62, table 12 (2005),
 15 28 as updated.
 15 29    6.  Evidence that asbestosis or diffuse bilateral pleural
 15 30 thickening, rather than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
 15 31 is a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's
 15 32 physical impairment, based on a determination that the exposed
 15 33 person has any of the following:
 15 34    a.  FVC below the predicted lower limit of normal and
 15 35 FEV1/FVC ratio, using actual values, at or above the predicted
 16  1 lower limit of normal.
 16  2    b.  Total lung capacity, by plethysmography or timed gas
 16  3 dilution, below the predicted lower limit of normal.
 16  4    c.  A chest X ray showing bilateral small, irregular
 16  5 opacities (s, t, or u) graded by a certified B=reader as at
 16  6 least 2/1 on the ILO scale.
 16  7    7.  The qualified physician signing the detailed narrative
 16  8 medical report has concluded that exposure to asbestos was
 16  9 a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's
 16 10 physical impairment and not more probably the result of other
 16 11 causes. An opinion that the medical findings and impairment
 16 12 are consistent with or compatible with exposure to asbestos,
 16 13 or similar opinion, does not satisfy the requirements of this
 16 14 subsection.
 16 15    Sec. 14.   14 22    An asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition shall
 14 23 not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima facie

 14 25 which asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor.

 15 11 most knowledgeable, including a thorough review of the past and
 15 12 present medical problems of the exposed person and the most

 15 17    5.  Evidence based upon a personal medical examination
 15 18 and pulmonary function testing of the exposed person or,

 15 29    6.  Evidence that asbestosis or diffuse bilateral pleural
 15 30 thickening, rather than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
 15 31 is a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person's
 15 32 physical impairment, based on a determination that the exposed
 15 33 person has any of the following:

 24 27 prioritization, and successor corporation asbestos=related
 24 28 liability, and includes applicability provisions.
 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 24 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 24 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 24 25    This bill relates to disclosure of asbestos bankruptcy trust
 24 26 claims in civil asbestos actions, asbestos and silica claims

 24 28 liability, and includes applicability provisions.
 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new

 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the

 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or

 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a

 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an

 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a

 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative

 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result

 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be

 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,

 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date

 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has

 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical

 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would

 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to

 24 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 24 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 24 25    This bill relates to disclosure of asbestos bankruptcy trust
 24 26 claims in civil asbestos actions, asbestos and silica claims
 24 27 prioritization, and successor corporation asbestos=related
 24 28 liability, and includes applicability provisions.
 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets

 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would

 24 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 24 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 24 25    This bill relates to disclosure of asbestos bankruptcy trust
 24 26 claims in civil asbestos actions, asbestos and silica claims
 24 27 prioritization, and successor corporation asbestos=related
 24 28 liability, and includes applicability provisions.
 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a

 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor

 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross

 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or

 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 24 22                           EXPLANATION
 24 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 24 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 24 25    This bill relates to disclosure of asbestos bankruptcy trust
 24 26 claims in civil asbestos actions, asbestos and silica claims
 24 27 prioritization, and successor corporation asbestos=related
 24 28 liability, and includes applicability provisions.
 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related

 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets

 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new

 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later

 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing

 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 24 27 prioritization, and successor corporation asbestos=related
 24 28 liability, and includes applicability provisions.
 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance

 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of

 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts

 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date

 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually

 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical

 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 24 25    This bill relates to disclosure of asbestos bankruptcy trust
 24 26 claims in civil asbestos actions, asbestos and silica claims
 24 27 prioritization, and successor corporation asbestos=related
 24 28 liability, and includes applicability provisions.
 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence

 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.

 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would

 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the

 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets

 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the

 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has

 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.

 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would

 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets

 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the

 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 24 29    ASBESTOS BANKRUPTCY TRUST CLAIMS.  The bill enacts new
 24 30 Code chapter 686A, which requires a plaintiff in an asbestos
 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross

 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the

 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts

 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified

 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be

 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to

 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the

 24 31 action to disclose documents and information related to claims
 24 32 against an asbestos trust to a defendant within the later of 30
 24 33 days of filing an asbestos action or 30 days of the effective
 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the

 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include

 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that

 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of

 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or

 24 34 date of the bill. If the plaintiff fails to comply with these
 24 35 requirements, the court may dismiss the action.
 25  1 The bill provides that a defendant may file a motion
 25  2 requesting a stay of the proceedings on or before the later
 25  3 of the 60th day before the date trial in the action is set to
 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the

 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the

 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and

 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and

 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date

 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually

 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima

 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 25  4 commence or the 15th day after the defendant first obtains
 25  5 information that could support additional trust claims by the
 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.

 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion

 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief

 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.

 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion

 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief

 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application

 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 25  6 plaintiff. The motion shall identify the asbestos trust claims
 25  7 the defendant believes the plaintiff can file and include
 25  8 information supporting the asbestos trust claims.
 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts

 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or

 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets

 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to

 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or

 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date

 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the

 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of

 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a

 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified

 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to

 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related

 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant

 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would

 25  9    The bill provides that trust claims materials and trust
 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 25 10 governance documents are presumed to be relevant and authentic,
 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or
 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and

 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the

 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.

 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or

 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and

 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective

 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of

 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a

 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified

 25 11 and are admissible in evidence in an asbestos action. A claim
 25 12 of privilege does not apply to any trust claims materials or

 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the

 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing

 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an

 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective

 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever

 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or

 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The

 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28 30 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 25 13 trust governance documents. The bill provides that trust
 25 14 claim materials that are sufficient to entitle a claim to
 25 15 consideration for payment under the applicable trust governance
 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would

 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually

 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would

 25 16 documents may be sufficient to support a jury finding that
 25 17 the plaintiff may have been exposed to products for which the
 25 18 trust was established to provide compensation and that, under
 25 19 applicable law, such exposure may be a substantial contributing
 25 20 factor in causing the plaintiff's injury that is at issue in
 25 21 the asbestos action.
 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an
 25 31 asbestos trust.
 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and

 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to

 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.
 26  7    The bill applies to all asbestos actions filed on or after
 26  8 the effective date of the bill, and to all pending asbestos
 26  9 actions in which trial has not commenced as of the effective
 26 10 date of the bill unless the court finds that the application
 26 11 of a provision of the bill would unconstitutionally affect a
 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the

 25 22    If a plaintiff proceeds to trial in an asbestos action before
 25 23 an asbestos trust claim is resolved, there is a rebuttable
 25 24 presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to, and will
 25 25 receive, the compensation specified in the trust governance
 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of
 25 27 trial.
 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and

 25 26 document applicable to the plaintiff's claim at the time of

 25 28    In any asbestos action in which damages are awarded and
 25 29 setoffs are permitted, a defendant is entitled to a setoff or
 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an

 25 32    The bill provides that if the plaintiff or a person on
 25 33 the plaintiff's behalf files an asbestos trust claim after
 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.

 26 12 vested right. In that case, the provision does not apply and
 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all

 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.

 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,

 25 30 credit in the amount the plaintiff has been awarded from an

 25 34 the plaintiff obtains a judgment in an asbestos action,
 25 35 and that asbestos trust was in existence at the time the
 26  1 plaintiff obtained the judgment, the trial court, on motion
 26  2 by a defendant or judgment debtor seeking sanctions or other
 26  3 relief, has jurisdiction to reopen the judgment and adjust
 26  4 the judgment by the amount of any subsequent asbestos trust
 26  5 payments obtained by the plaintiff and order any other relief
 26  6 to the parties that the court considers just and proper.

 26 13 the court shall apply prior law.
 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an

 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective

 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has

 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed

 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result

 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima

 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever

 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all

 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to

 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date

 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has

 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified

 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 27 33 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 27 35 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28  1 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the
 28  2 provision does not apply and the court shall apply prior law.
 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.
 28 24    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 28 25 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all
 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court
 28 28 finds that the application of a provision in the bill would
 28 29 unconstitutionally affect a vested right. In that case, the

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative

 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action

 26 14    ASBESTOS AND SILICA CLAIMS PRIORITIZATION.  The bill enacts
 26 15 new Code chapter 686B, which provides that a plaintiff in an
 26 16 asbestos action involving a nonmalignant condition or a silica
 26 17 action involving silicosis shall file with the complaint or
 26 18 other initial pleading a detailed narrative medical report
 26 19 and diagnosis, signed under oath by a qualified physician and
 26 20 accompanied by supporting test results, which constitute prima
 26 21 facie evidence that the exposed person meets the requirements
 26 22 of the bill. The report must not be prepared by an attorney.
 26 23 For an asbestos or silica action pending as of the effective
 26 24 date of the bill, the detailed narrative medical report and
 26 25 supporting test results and sworn information shall be provided
 26 26 to all parties not later than 90 days after the effective date
 26 27 of the bill or not later than 90 days before trial, whichever
 26 28 is earlier. The court shall dismiss the asbestos or silica
 26 29 action without prejudice on finding that the plaintiff has
 26 30 failed to make the prima facie showing required by the bill or
 26 31 failed to comply with the requirements of the bill. The bill
 26 32 provides that asbestos and silica actions must be individually
 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the
 27 16 bill.
 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions
 27 32 filed on or after the effective date of the bill, and to all

 27 34 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
 28 23 successor corporations.

 28 26 pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not
 28 27 commenced as of the effective date of the bill unless the court

 26 33 filed and may not be filed on behalf of a group or class of
 26 34 plaintiffs.
 26 35    The bill provides that an asbestos action involving a
 27  1 nonmalignant condition or a silica action involving silicosis
 27  2 shall not be brought or maintained in the absence of prima
 27  3 facie evidence that the exposed person has a physical
 27  4 impairment for which exposure to asbestos or silica was a
 27  5 substantial contributing factor. The prima facie showing shall
 27  6 be made as to each defendant and include a detailed narrative
 27  7 medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified
 27  8 physician that includes certain specified information. The
 27  9 bill requires the qualified physician signing the detailed
 27 10 narrative medical report to conclude that exposure to asbestos
 27 11 or silica was a substantial contributing factor to the exposed
 27 12 person's physical impairment and not more probably the result
 27 13 of other causes. An opinion that the medical findings and
 27 14 impairment are consistent with or compatible with exposure to
 27 15 asbestos or silica does not satisfy the requirements of the

 27 17    The bill provides that evidence relating to the prima
 27 18 facie showings required under the bill shall not create any
 27 19 presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos=related
 27 20 or silica=related injury or impairment, and shall not be
 27 21 conclusive as to the liability of any defendant. Until a
 27 22 court enters an order determining that the exposed person has
 27 23 established prima facie evidence of impairment, no asbestos or
 27 24 silica action shall be subject to discovery, except discovery
 27 25 related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence
 27 26 or by order of the trial court upon motion of one of the parties
 27 27 and for good cause shown.
 27 28    An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant
 27 29 condition shall be a distinct cause of action from an action
 27 30 for an asbestos=related or silica=related cancer.
 27 31    The bill applies to all asbestos and silica actions

 28  3    SUCCESSOR CORPORATION ASBESTOS=RELATED LIABILITY.  The
 28  4 bill enacts new Code chapter 686C, which limits liability
 28  5 related to asbestos actions which were assumed or incurred by a
 28  6 corporation as the result of a merger or consolidation.  The
 28  7 bill provides that the cumulative successor asbestos=related
 28  8 liabilities of a successor corporation are limited to the
 28  9 fair market value of the total gross assets of the transferor
 28 10 determined as of the time of the merger or consolidation.
 28 11    The fair market value of the total gross assets may be
 28 12 determined by any method reasonable under the circumstances,
 28 13 including by reference to the going concern value of the assets
 28 14 or to the purchase price attributable to or paid for the assets
 28 15 in an arms=length transaction, or, in the absence of other
 28 16 readily available information from which the fair market value
 28 17 can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets
 28 18 recorded on a balance sheet.
 28 19    The bill provides that the fair market value of total gross
 28 20 assets shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of
 28 21 the prime rate plus 1 percent.
 28 22    The bill is to be liberally construed with regard to
