  8  6                           EXPLANATION
  8  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  9    This bill authorizes a county or city, or one or more
  8 10 counties and one or more cities within those counties to create
  8 11 an energy investment district to finance energy investment
  8 12 projects for the benefit of property within the district.
  8 13    The bill defines an "energy investment" to mean an
  8 14 acquisition, installation, or modification benefitting
  8 15 private property, except residential property with fewer than
  8 16 three residential units, that is intended to reduce energy
  8 17 consumption or energy costs, or both, or to allow for the use
  8 18 of alternate and renewable energy. The bill specifies measures
  8 19 that are considered energy investments.
  8 20    The bill requires the governing bodies of the counties
  8 21 and cities participating in an energy investment district
  8 22 to appoint an energy investment district board to manage
  8 23 and administer the district. The board must consist of at
  8 24 least three members, but in no case fewer than the number of
  8 25 participating cities and counties, and the agreement creating
  8 26 the district must set the term length of board members.
  8 27    The bill authorizes a board to exercise all powers and
  8 28 duties necessary to manage and administer the energy investment
  8 29 district, as provided in the agreement, including the power to
  8 30 adopt bylaws, adopt an official seal, sue and be sued, make and
  8 31 enter into contracts with public and private entities, employ
  8 32 staff, levy and collect special assessments, borrow money from
  8 33 a public or private source and issue bonds, finance energy
  8 34 investment projects, collect fees, and invest funds. A board
  8 35 must exist for a minimum duration necessary to finance any
  9  1 assessment contracts that the board enters into.
  9  2    The bill requires a board to enter into an assessment
  9  3 contract with a property owner to finance a project if the
  9  4 board finds that there are sufficient resources for the
  9  5 project, the estimated monetary benefit, as determined by the
  9  6 board after consulting with an outside expert, is equal to or
  9  7 greater than the total cost of the project, and the project
  9  8 complies with all applicable ordinances and regulations in the
  9  9 county or city where the property is located. An assessment
  9 10 contract executed between a board and a property owner must
  9 11 include a description of the project, a mechanism for verifying
  9 12 the final costs of the project and ensuring that financing
  9 13 provided does not exceed the final costs of the project, an
  9 14 agreement by the property owner to pay special assessments and
  9 15 any applicable fees for a specified period and a schedule of
  9 16 assessments, a statement that the obligations provided in the
  9 17 assessment contract are a covenant that run with the land,
  9 18 an acknowledgment that subdividing property subject to the
  9 19 contract requires the contract or an amendment to the contract
  9 20 to divide the total special assessments due, and written
  9 21 consent to the levy and collection of special assessments and
  9 22 any applicable fees charged from all entities holding mortgages
  9 23 on the property or contract sellers of the property.
  9 24    The bill requires a board to provide a copy of a signed
  9 25 assessment contract to the local assessor and county auditor
  9 26 of the county where the property is located, as well as filing
  9 27 the agreement with the county recorder. A board is authorized
  9 28 to enter into more than one assessment contract for a single
  9 29 property so long as each contract relates to a separate
  9 30 project. A board shall determine an inspection procedure for
  9 31 completed energy investments financed pursuant to the bill.
  9 32    The bill provides that the total special assessments levied
  9 33 by a board cannot exceed the sum of the cost of the project,
  9 34 including all incidental costs and fees. A board may also
  9 35 charge a fee of up to 1 percent of the total cost of the
 10  1 project, not to exceed $20,000. A board must levy and collect
 10  2 special assessments in the manner as provided in the assessment
 10  3 contract and with the same priority as real property taxes.
 10  4 Special assessments and fees not paid within the time period
 10  5 set forth in the assessment contract are delinquent and become
 10  6 a lien on the property. A board may collect such delinquent
 10  7 assessments and fees in the manner of property taxes pursuant
 10  8 to Code sections 445.3 and 445.4.
 10  9    The bill authorizes a board to issue bonds payable from the
 10 10 special assessments. The board must authorize an issuance of
 10 11 bonds by resolution and may determine the form of the bonds,
 10 12 so long as any interest rates do not exceed those permitted by
 10 13 Code chapter 74A.  The bonds do not constitute a debt of the
 10 14 state or of the city or county where the property is located,
 10 15 and must contain a statement to that effect.
 10 16    The bill requires a board to submit an annual report to
 10 17 the governing body of each participating county and city in
 10 18 the district, which must include, for the preceding year, a
 10 19 description of each project completed, the amount of special
 10 20 assessments due and the amount collected for the fiscal year
 10 21 ending during the preceding year, a summary of the public
 10 22 benefits resulting from the projects completed, a description
 10 23 of assessment contracts entered into, and the amount of
 10 24 administrative costs incurred by the board.

  8 10 counties and one or more cities within those counties to create
  8 11 an energy investment district to finance energy investment
  8 12 projects for the benefit of property within the district.
  8 13    The bill defines an "energy investment" to mean an
  8 14 acquisition, installation, or modification benefitting
  8 15 private property, except residential property with fewer than
  8 16 three residential units, that is intended to reduce energy
  8 17 consumption or energy costs, or both, or to allow for the use
  8 18 of alternate and renewable energy. The bill specifies measures
  8 19 that are considered energy investments.
  8 20    The bill requires the governing bodies of the counties
  8 21 and cities participating in an energy investment district
  8 22 to appoint an energy investment district board to manage
  8 23 and administer the district. The board must consist of at
  8 24 least three members, but in no case fewer than the number of
  8 25 participating cities and counties, and the agreement creating
  8 26 the district must set the term length of board members.
  8 27    The bill authorizes a board to exercise all powers and
  8 28 duties necessary to manage and administer the energy investment
  8 29 district, as provided in the agreement, including the power to
  8 30 adopt bylaws, adopt an official seal, sue and be sued, make and
  8 31 enter into contracts with public and private entities, employ
  8 32 staff, levy and collect special assessments, borrow money from
  8 33 a public or private source and issue bonds, finance energy
  8 34 investment projects, collect fees, and invest funds. A board
  8 35 must exist for a minimum duration necessary to finance any
  9  1 assessment contracts that the board enters into.
  9  2    The bill requires a board to enter into an assessment
  9  3 contract with a property owner to finance a project if the
  9  4 board finds that there are sufficient resources for the
  9  5 project, the estimated monetary benefit, as determined by the
  9  6 board after consulting with an outside expert, is equal to or
  9  7 greater than the total cost of the project, and the project
  9  8 complies with all applicable ordinances and regulations in the
  9  9 county or city where the property is located. An assessment
  9 10 contract executed between a board and a property owner must
  9 11 include a description of the project, a mechanism for verifying
  9 12 the final costs of the project and ensuring that financing
  9 13 provided does not exceed the final costs of the project, an
  9 14 agreement by the property owner to pay special assessments and
  9 15 any applicable fees for a specified period and a schedule of
  9 16 assessments, a statement that the obligations provided in the
  9 17 assessment contract are a covenant that run with the land,
  9 18 an acknowledgment that subdividing property subject to the
  9 19 contract requires the contract or an amendment to the contract
  9 20 to divide the total special assessments due, and written
  9 21 consent to the levy and collection of special assessments and
  9 22 any applicable fees charged from all entities holding mortgages
  9 23 on the property or contract sellers of the property.
  9 24    The bill requires a board to provide a copy of a signed
  9 25 assessment contract to the local assessor and county auditor
  9 26 of the county where the property is located, as well as filing
  9 27 the agreement with the county recorder. A board is authorized
  9 28 to enter into more than one assessment contract for a single
  9 29 property so long as each contract relates to a separate
  9 30 project. A board shall determine an inspection procedure for
  9 31 completed energy investments financed pursuant to the bill.
  9 32    The bill provides that the total special assessments levied
  9 33 by a board cannot exceed the sum of the cost of the project,
  9 34 including all incidental costs and fees. A board may also
  9 35 charge a fee of up to 1 percent of the total cost of the
 10  1 project, not to exceed $20,000. A board must levy and collect
 10  2 special assessments in the manner as provided in the assessment
 10  3 contract and with the same priority as real property taxes.
 10  4 Special assessments and fees not paid within the time period
 10  5 set forth in the assessment contract are delinquent and become
 10  6 a lien on the property. A board may collect such delinquent
 10  7 assessments and fees in the manner of property taxes pursuant
 10  8 to Code sections 445.3 and 445.4.
 10  9    The bill authorizes a board to issue bonds payable from the
 10 10 special assessments. The board must authorize an issuance of
 10 11 bonds by resolution and may determine the form of the bonds,
 10 12 so long as any interest rates do not exceed those permitted by
 10 13 Code chapter 74A.  The bonds do not constitute a debt of the
 10 14 state or of the city or county where the property is located,
 10 15 and must contain a statement to that effect.
 10 16    The bill requires a board to submit an annual report to
 10 17 the governing body of each participating county and city in
 10 18 the district, which must include, for the preceding year, a
 10 19 description of each project completed, the amount of special
 10 20 assessments due and the amount collected for the fiscal year
 10 21 ending during the preceding year, a summary of the public

  8 13    The bill defines an "energy investment" to mean an
  8 14 acquisition, installation, or modification benefitting
  8 15 private property, except residential property with fewer than
  8 16 three residential units, that is intended to reduce energy
  8 17 consumption or energy costs, or both, or to allow for the use
  8 18 of alternate and renewable energy. The bill specifies measures
  8 19 that are considered energy investments.
  8 20    The bill requires the governing bodies of the counties
  8 21 and cities participating in an energy investment district
  8 22 to appoint an energy investment district board to manage
  8 23 and administer the district. The board must consist of at
  8 24 least three members, but in no case fewer than the number of
  8 25 participating cities and counties, and the agreement creating
  8 26 the district must set the term length of board members.
  8 27    The bill authorizes a board to exercise all powers and
  8 28 duties necessary to manage and administer the energy investment
  8 29 district, as provided in the agreement, including the power to
  8 30 adopt bylaws, adopt an official seal, sue and be sued, make and
  8 31 enter into contracts with public and private entities, employ
  8 32 staff, levy and collect special assessments, borrow money from
  8 33 a public or private source and issue bonds, finance energy
  8 34 investment projects, collect fees, and invest funds. A board
  8 35 must exist for a minimum duration necessary to finance any
  9  1 assessment contracts that the board enters into.
  9  2    The bill requires a board to enter into an assessment
  9  3 contract with a property owner to finance a project if the
  9  4 board finds that there are sufficient resources for the
  9  5 project, the estimated monetary benefit, as determined by the
  9  6 board after consulting with an outside expert, is equal to or
  9  7 greater than the total cost of the project, and the project
  9  8 complies with all applicable ordinances and regulations in the
  9  9 county or city where the property is located. An assessment
  9 10 contract executed between a board and a property owner must
  9 11 include a description of the project, a mechanism for verifying
  9 12 the final costs of the project and ensuring that financing
  9 13 provided does not exceed the final costs of the project, an
  9 14 agreement by the property owner to pay special assessments and
  9 15 any applicable fees for a specified period and a schedule of
  9 16 assessments, a statement that the obligations provided in the
  9 17 assessment contract are a covenant that run with the land,
  9 18 an acknowledgment that subdividing property subject to the
  9 19 contract requires the contract or an amendment to the contract
  9 20 to divide the total special assessments due, and written
  9 21 consent to the levy and collection of special assessments and
  9 22 any applicable fees charged from all entities holding mortgages
  9 23 on the property or contract sellers of the property.
  9 24    The bill requires a board to provide a copy of a signed
  9 25 assessment contract to the local assessor and county auditor
  9 26 of the county where the property is located, as well as filing
  9 27 the agreement with the county recorder. A board is authorized
  9 28 to enter into more than one assessment contract for a single
  9 29 property so long as each contract relates to a separate
  9 30 project. A board shall determine an inspection procedure for
  9 31 completed energy investments financed pursuant to the bill.
  9 32    The bill provides that the total special assessments levied
  9 33 by a board cannot exceed the sum of the cost of the project,
  9 34 including all incidental costs and fees. A board may also
  9 35 charge a fee of up to 1 percent of the total cost of the
 10  1 project, not to exceed $20,000. A board must levy and collect
 10  2 special assessments in the manner as provided in the assessment
 10  3 contract and with the same priority as real property taxes.
 10  4 Special assessments and fees not paid within the time period
 10  5 set forth in the assessment contract are delinquent and become
 10  6 a lien on the property. A board may collect such delinquent
 10  7 assessments and fees in the manner of property taxes pursuant
 10  8 to Code sections 445.3 and 445.4.
 10  9    The bill authorizes a board to issue bonds payable from the
 10 10 special assessments. The board must authorize an issuance of
 10 11 bonds by resolution and may determine the form of the bonds,
 10 12 so long as any interest rates do not exceed those permitted by
 10 13 Code chapter 74A.  The bonds do not constitute a debt of the
 10 14 state or of the city or county where the property is located,
 10 15 and must contain a statement to that effect.
 10 16    The bill requires a board to submit an annual report to
 10 17 the governing body of each participating county and city in
 10 18 the district, which must include, for the preceding year, a
 10 19 description of each project completed, the amount of special

  9  6 board after consulting with an outside expert, is equal to or
  9  7 greater than the total cost of the project, and the project
  9  8 complies with all applicable ordinances and regulations in the
  9  9 county or city where the property is located. An assessment
  9 10 contract executed between a board and a property owner must
  9 11 include a description of the project, a mechanism for verifying
  9 12 the final costs of the project and ensuring that financing
  9 13 provided does not exceed the final costs of the project, an

  9 25 assessment contract to the local assessor and county auditor
  9 26 of the county where the property is located, as well as filing
  9 27 the agreement with the county recorder. A board is authorized
  9 28 to enter into more than one assessment contract for a single
  9 29 property so long as each contract relates to a separate
  9 30 project. A board shall determine an inspection procedure for
  9 31 completed energy investments financed pursuant to the bill.
  9 32    The bill provides that the total special assessments levied
  9 33 by a board cannot exceed the sum of the cost of the project,
  9 34 including all incidental costs and fees. A board may also

 10  1 project, not to exceed $20,000. A board must levy and collect
 10  2 special assessments in the manner as provided in the assessment
 10  3 contract and with the same priority as real property taxes.
 10  4 Special assessments and fees not paid within the time period
 10  5 set forth in the assessment contract are delinquent and become

 10 11 bonds by resolution and may determine the form of the bonds,
 10 12 so long as any interest rates do not exceed those permitted by
 10 13 Code chapter 74A.  The bonds do not constitute a debt of the
 10 14 state or of the city or county where the property is located,

  8  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  9    This bill authorizes a county or city, or one or more
  8 10 counties and one or more cities within those counties to create
  8 11 an energy investment district to finance energy investment
  8 12 projects for the benefit of property within the district.
  8 13    The bill defines an "energy investment" to mean an
  8 14 acquisition, installation, or modification benefitting
  8 15 private property, except residential property with fewer than
  8 16 three residential units, that is intended to reduce energy
  8 17 consumption or energy costs, or both, or to allow for the use
  8 18 of alternate and renewable energy. The bill specifies measures
  8 19 that are considered energy investments.
  8 20    The bill requires the governing bodies of the counties
  8 21 and cities participating in an energy investment district
  8 22 to appoint an energy investment district board to manage
  8 23 and administer the district. The board must consist of at
  8 24 least three members, but in no case fewer than the number of
  8 25 participating cities and counties, and the agreement creating
  8 26 the district must set the term length of board members.
  8 27    The bill authorizes a board to exercise all powers and
  8 28 duties necessary to manage and administer the energy investment
  8 29 district, as provided in the agreement, including the power to

  8 31 enter into contracts with public and private entities, employ
  8 32 staff, levy and collect special assessments, borrow money from
  8 33 a public or private source and issue bonds, finance energy
  8 34 investment projects, collect fees, and invest funds. A board
  8 35 must exist for a minimum duration necessary to finance any
  9  1 assessment contracts that the board enters into.
  9  2    The bill requires a board to enter into an assessment
  9  3 contract with a property owner to finance a project if the

  9  5 project, the estimated monetary benefit, as determined by the
  9  6 board after consulting with an outside expert, is equal to or
  9  7 greater than the total cost of the project, and the project
  9  8 complies with all applicable ordinances and regulations in the
  9  9 county or city where the property is located. An assessment
  9 10 contract executed between a board and a property owner must
  9 11 include a description of the project, a mechanism for verifying
  9 12 the final costs of the project and ensuring that financing
  9 13 provided does not exceed the final costs of the project, an
  9 14 agreement by the property owner to pay special assessments and
  9 15 any applicable fees for a specified period and a schedule of
  9 16 assessments, a statement that the obligations provided in the
  9 17 assessment contract are a covenant that run with the land,
  9 18 an acknowledgment that subdividing property subject to the
  9 19 contract requires the contract or an amendment to the contract
  9 20 to divide the total special assessments due, and written
  9 21 consent to the levy and collection of special assessments and
  9 22 any applicable fees charged from all entities holding mortgages
  9 23 on the property or contract sellers of the property.
  9 24    The bill requires a board to provide a copy of a signed
  9 25 assessment contract to the local assessor and county auditor
  9 26 of the county where the property is located, as well as filing
  9 27 the agreement with the county recorder. A board is authorized
  9 28 to enter into more than one assessment contract for a single
  9 29 property so long as each contract relates to a separate
  9 30 project. A board shall determine an inspection procedure for
  9 31 completed energy investments financed pursuant to the bill.
  9 32    The bill provides that the total special assessments levied
  9 33 by a board cannot exceed the sum of the cost of the project,
  9 34 including all incidental costs and fees. A board may also
  9 35 charge a fee of up to 1 percent of the total cost of the
