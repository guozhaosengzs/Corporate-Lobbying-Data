  4 15 in the violation of a right guaranteed by the Constitution of
  4 16 the United States or the Constitution of the State of Iowa,
  4 17 including but not limited to due process; freedom of religion,
  4 18 speech, or press; and any right of privacy or marriage embodied
  4 19 in the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  4 20    The bill further specifies that it is the public policy of
  4 21 this state to fully recognize the right to contract freely
  4 22 under the laws of this state, and also to recognize that this
  4 23 right may be reasonably and rationally circumscribed pursuant
  4 24 to the state's interest to protect and promote rights and
  4 25 privileges granted under the Constitution of the United States
  4 26 and the Constitution of the State of Iowa.

  4 33 include the laws of the Native American tribes of this state as
  4 34 that jurisdiction is within this state.
  4 35    The bill establishes that it is a violation of the public
  5  1 policy of this state if any court, arbitration, tribunal,
  5  2 or administrative agency ruling or decision bases a ruling
  5  3 or decision in the matter at issue in whole or in part
  5  4 on any law, legal code, or system, that would not grant
  5  5 the parties affected by the ruling or decision the same
  5  6 fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the
  5  7 Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the
  5  8 State of Iowa.  The bill specifies such a ruling is void and

  5 13 between the parties arising from a contract mutually agreed
  5 14 upon violates the public policy of this state and shall be void
  5 15 and unenforceable if the law, legal code, or system chosen
  5 16 includes or incorporates any substantive or procedural law,
  5 17 as applied to the dispute at issue, that would not grant the
  5 18 parties the same fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges
  5 19 granted under the Constitution of the United States and the
  5 20 Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  5 21    A contract or contractual provision under the bill, if
  5 22 capable of segregation, which specifies jurisdiction for
  5 23 the purpose of granting the courts or arbitration panels in
  5 24 personam jurisdiction over the parties to adjudicate any
  5 25 disputes between the parties arising from a contract mutually
  5 26 agreed upon, shall be void and unenforceable if the law, legal
  5 27 code, or system chosen includes or incorporates any substantive
  5 28 or procedural law, as applied to the dispute at issue, that
  5 29 would not grant the parties the same fundamental liberties,
  5 30 rights, and privileges granted under the Constitution of the
  5 31 United States and the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  5 32    If a person of this state, subject to personal jurisdiction
  5 33 in this state, seeks to maintain litigation, arbitration,
  5 34 agency, or similarly binding proceedings in this state and if

  6  1 non conveniens or a related claim violates the constitutional
  6  2 rights of the nonclaimant in the foreign forum with respect
  6  3 to the matter in dispute, the bill requires that the claim be
  6  4 denied.

  6  6 limited liability corporation, business association, or other
  6  7 legal entity that contracts to subject itself to foreign law in
  6  8 a jurisdiction other that this state or the United States.  The
  6  9 bill also does not apply to many activities involving a church
  6 10 or religious organization.
  6 11    Additionally, the provisions of the bill shall not be
  6 12 interpreted by any court to conflict with any federal treaty or
  6 13 other international agreement to which the United States is a
  6 14 party to the extent that such treaty or international agreement
