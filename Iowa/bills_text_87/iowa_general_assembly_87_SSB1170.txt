The

by
the

This

20


Code
section

is
amended
to
provide
that
if
an
21


employer
shows
that
at
the
time
of
an
injury
for
which
workers’
22


compensation
is
sought,
an
employee
had
positive
test
results
23


reflecting
the
presence
of
alcohol
or
drugs,
there
is
a
24


presumption
that
the
employee
was
intoxicated
at
the
time
of
25


the
injury,
and
the
intoxication
was
the
predominant
factor
in
26


causing
the
injury,
making
the
injury
not
compensable.
The
27


provision
also
allows
the
employee
to
overcome
that
presumption
28


by
establishing
that
the
employee
was
not
intoxicated
or
that
29


intoxication
was
not
the
predominant
factor
in
causing
the
30


injury.
31


Code
section
85.18
is
amended
to
provide
that
imposition
of
32


liability
on
any
employer
under

does
not
create

a
private
