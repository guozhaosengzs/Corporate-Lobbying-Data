the
state
are
directly
related

educational
16


levels

citizens
of
the
state,
and
that
a
17


vital
and

served
by
the
creation
and
18


implementation
of
programs
which
encourage
and
make
possible
19


the
attainment
of
higher


formal
education
by
the
greatest
20


number
of

of
the
state.
The

21


resources
to
provide

the


23


state’s
public
institutions

higher
education
and
the
general
24


welfare
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
will
be
enhanced
by
25


establishing
a
program
which
allows
citizens
of
the
state
to
26


invest
money
in
a
public
trust
for
future
application
to
the
27


payment
of
higher
education
costs

expenses
.
28


The
creation
of
the
means
of
encouragement
for
citizens
to
29


invest
in
such
a
program
represents
the
carrying
out
of
a
30


vital
and
valid
public
purpose.
In
order
to
make
available
31


to
the
citizens
of
the
state
an
opportunity
to
fund
future
32


higher


formal
education
needs,
it
is
necessary
that
a
public
33


trust
be
established
in
which
moneys
may
be
invested
for
future
34


educational
use.

The

federal
Protecting
Americans
From
Tax
Hikes
Act
(PATH
Act)
8


enacted
by
Congress
in
2015
made
permanent
certain

amounts
and
increased
credit
percentages
of
the
10


federal
earned
income
tax
credit
(EITC)
that
were
scheduled
to

expire
in

deduction
for
certain
12


expenses
incurred
by
elementary
and
secondary
school
teachers
13


that
was
scheduled
to
expire
in

To

Iowa
has
14


not
coupled
with
these
federal
changes
for
purposes
of
the
15


teacher
expense
deduction
or
for
calculating
the
Iowa
EITC.

TAX
RATE
AND
TAX
BRACKET
CHANGES.
Current
law
provides
nine
6


regular
tax
brackets
containing
progressively
higher
amounts
7


of
taxable
income
that
are
taxed
at
progressively
higher
tax

as
described
in

bill.
A

will
not

the

year
to

to
a
lower
19


tax
rate
category
than
is
currently
in

20


By
operation
of
law,
the
tax
rate
category
applicable
to
tax
21


year
2025
will
also
apply
to
all
future
tax
years.
22


The
bill
requires
the
department
of
revenue
(department),
in
23


consultation
with
the
department
of
management,
to
calculate
24


net
tax
receipts
each
applicable
fiscal
year
and
submit
an
25


annual
report
to
the
governor
and
general
assembly
identifying
26


net
tax
receipts
for
the
fiscal
year,
which
tax
rate
category
27


will
be
in
effect
for
future
tax
years,
and
describing
in
28


detail
the
net
tax
receipts
calculation
made
by
the
department.
29


The
bill
defines
“net

and
requires
the
director
30


of
the
department
to
adopt
rules
for
calculating
net

31


receipts

defining

in

the
PATH
Act
of
2015
and
the
federal
Tax
Cuts

purposes
of
the
individual
income
tax
beginning
in
tax
year
6


2019,
except
for
certain
revisions
as
described
below.
The
7


coupling
is
accomplished
generally
by
updating
the
definition
8


of
IRC
as
it
applies
to
the
individual
income
tax
to
mean
9


the
IRC
as
amended
and
in
effect
on
January
1,
2018.
The
10


updated
definition
does
not
apply
to
the
state
solar
energy

system
credit
in
Code
section
422.11L,
or
the
state
individual
12


research
activities
credit
in
Code
section
422.10,
because
both
13


of
those
credits
contain
their
own
definition
of
IRC.
14


Code
section
422.9
provided
individuals
a
deduction
from
15


net
income
for
state
sales
and
use
taxes
if
the
individual
16


chose
to
deduct
sales
and
use
tax
in
lieu
of
state
income
taxes
17


or
the
standard
deduction
for
federal
income
tax
purposes.
18


The
deduction
was
set
to
expire
under
both
federal
and
Iowa
19


law
beginning
in
tax
year
2016.
The
federal
deduction
was
20


made
permanent
by
the
PATH
Act
of
2015,
and
the
bill
couples
21


with
these
federal
changes
to
the
deduction,
thus
making
it
22


permanent
for
tax
year
2019
and
beyond.
23


The
federal
deduction
for
other
taxes
paid
was
limited
to
24


$10,000
per
year
under
most
circumstances
by
the
federal
Tax
25


Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
2017,
but
the
bill
decouples
from
this
26


limitation.
Taxpayers
will
be
allowed
to
deduct
other
taxes
27


paid
in
computing
state
itemized
deductions
to
the
same
extent
28


as
is
allowed
under
current
state
law,
without
regard
to
the
29


$10,000
limitation
described
above.

in

existing
state
law

the
amount

depreciation

federal

without

5


to

6


IRC
§179
DEDUCTION.
The
IRC
§179
deduction
provides
a
tax
7


deduction
in
lieu
of
depreciation
for
certain
property
placed
8


in
service
during
a
tax
year.
Under
current
law,
for
Iowa
9


tax
purposes,
the
maximum
IRC
§179
deduction
per
tax
year
is
10


$25,000.
This
maximum
deduction
is
incrementally
reduced
when
11


a
taxpayer’s
eligible
property
placed
in
service
during
the
tax
12


year
exceeds
$200,000
(investment
limitation).
13


The
federal
Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
2017
made
several
14


changes
to
the
IRC
§179
deduction,
including
increasing
the
15


statutory
maximum
deduction
to
$1
million,
and
increasing
16


the
statutory
investment
limitation
to
$2.5
million.
The
17


bill
couples
for
Iowa
individual
income
tax
purposes
with
the
18


changes
made
to
the
IRC
§179
deduction
in
the
federal
Tax
Cuts
19


and
Jobs
Act
beginning
in
tax
year
2019,
but
limits
the
maximum
20


deduction
to
$100,000,
and
sets
the
investment
limitation
at
21


$400,000.
22


If
the
total
IRC
§179
deduction
allocated
to
a
taxpayer
from
23


one
or
more
partnerships,
S
corporations,
or
limited
liability
24


companies
exceeds
$100,000
in
a
tax
year,
the
bill
allows
the
25


taxpayer
to
deduct
the
amount
in
excess
of
$100,000
evenly
over
26


a
five-year
tax
period
beginning
in
the
subsequent
tax
year.
27


Taxpayers
who
elect
to
take
advantage
of
this
provision
are
28


not
allowed
to
take
the
IRC
§179
deduction
for
the
tax
year
29


of
the
election
on
any
eligible
property
placed
in
service
by
30


the
taxpayer,
but
are
allowed
to
deduct
depreciation
on
such
31


amounts
that
would
otherwise
be
allowable
under
federal
law,


32


without
regard
to
the
bonus
depreciation
allowance.
33


Under
current
Iowa
law,
for
previous
tax
years,
individual
34


taxpayers
were
required
to
recompute

to
account
for

differences

and
Iowa
treatment

IRC
§179

The

provides
that

to

beginning

ALTERNATIVE
MINIMUM
TAX
(AMT)
REPEAL.
Current
law
imposes
6


an
AMT
to
the
extent
it
exceeds
an
individual’s
regular
7


tax
liability.
The
AMT
is
generally
calculated
by
adding
8


certain
“preference”
items
(deductions,
exemptions,
and
other
9


adjustments)
back
to
taxable
income,
applying
an
exemption
10


amount,
and
then
multiplying
the
resulting
income
amount
by
an
11


AMT
rate.
The
bill
repeals
the
AMT
for
the
individual
income
12


tax
beginning
in
tax
year
2019.
The
bill
makes
corresponding
13


amendments
to
other
individual
income
tax
provisions
in
the
14


Code
to
strike
references
to
the
AMT
in
the
calculation
of
the
15


resident
tax
credit
for
income
tax
paid
to
another
jurisdiction
16


and
in
the
requirement
for
nonresidents
subject
to
the
AMT
to
17


file
an
Iowa
income
tax
return.
18


Current
law
also
provides
an
alternative
minimum
tax
credit,
19


which
allows
AMT
paid
by
an
individual
in
prior
tax
years
to
be
20


claimed
against
regular
tax
liability
in
future
tax
years
if
21


the
individual
is
not
subject
to
the
AMT
in
that
year.
With
22


the
repeal
of
the
individual
AMT
in
2019,
the
bill
allows
a
23


taxpayer
to
claim
any
remaining
alternative
minimum
tax
credit
24


against
the
individual’s
regular
tax
liability
for
the
2019
tax
25


year,
and
the
bill
then
repeals
the
alternative
minimum

beginning
in

2020.

STANDARD
DEDUCTION
INCREASES.
When
calculating
taxable
11


income
for
purposes
of
the
individual
income
tax,
individuals
12


are
allowed
to
choose
between
a
standard
deduction
or
itemized
13


deductions.
The
standard
deduction
under
current
law
for
tax
14


year
2018
is
$2,030
for
a
single
person
or
a
married
person
who
15


files
separately,
and
is
$5,000
for
a
married
couple
filing
16


jointly,
a
surviving
spouse,
or
a
head
of
household.
These
17


amounts
are
indexed
to
inflation
and
increased
each
year.
18


The
bill
increases
the
standard
deduction
amounts
beginning
19


in
tax
year
2019
to
$4,000
for
a
single
person
or
a
married
20


person
who
files
separately,
and
to
$8,000
for
a
married
couple
21


filing
jointly,
a
surviving
spouse,
or
a
head
of
household.
22


The
bill
also
provides
for
an
additional
standard
deduction
23


amount
for
each
individual
who
at
the
close
of
the
tax
year
24


is
65
or
older
or
is
blind.
The
determination
of
whether
an
25


individual
is
blind
is
the
same
as
for
the
personal
exemption
26


credit
under
Code
section
422.12.
The
additional
standard


27


deduction
amount
is
$1,500
per
person,
and
is
doubled
if
the
28


person
is
both
65
or
older
and
blind
at
the
end
of
the
tax
year.
29


The
bill
increases
each
of
these
additional
standard
deduction
30


amounts
to
$2,070
per
person
in
the
event
the
tax
rates
in
31


category
III,
IV,
or
V,
become
effective
in
future
tax
years.
32


The
bill
indexes
these
standard
deduction
amounts,
including
33


the
additional
standard
deduction
amounts,
to
inflation
so
they
34


will
be
increased
in
future
tax
years.

QUALIFIED
BUSINESS
INCOME
DEDUCTION.
The
federal
Tax
Cuts
1


and
Jobs
Act
of
2017
created
a
deduction
in
calculating
federal
2


taxable
income
for
noncorporate
taxpayers
of
up
to
20
percent
3


of
certain
domestic
qualified
business
income
earned
by
a
4


taxpayer
from
a
partnership,
S
corporation,
limited
liability
5


company,
other
pass-through
entity,
or
a
sole
proprietorship.
6


The
deduction
is
calculated
under
section
199A
of
the
IRC
7


and
includes
numerous
limitations
based
on
the
type
of
trade
8


or
business
involved,
the
income
of
the
trade
or
business,
9


and
the
income
of
the
taxpayer
claiming
the
deduction.
The
10


federal
deduction
applies
to
tax
years
2018
through
2025,
and
11


is
available
to
a
taxpayer
regardless
of
whether
the
taxpayer
12


claims
the
standard
deduction
or
itemized
deductions
for
13


federal
tax
purposes.
14


The
bill
provides
a
deduction
in
computing
Iowa
taxable
15


income
for
purposes
of
the
individual
income
tax
equal
to
25
16


percent
of
the
taxpayer’s
qualified
business
income
deduction
17


allowed
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
beginning
in
tax
18


year
2019.
With
regard
to
individuals,
the
Iowa
deduction
19


is
available
regardless
of
whether
the
individual
claims
20


the
standard
deduction
or
itemized
deductions
for
Iowa
tax
21


purposes.
With
regard
to
an
estate
or
trust,
the
starting
22


point
for
calculating
Iowa
income
tax
will
include
the
full
23


amount
of
the
federal
qualified
business
income
deduction,
so
24


the
bill
requires
the
estate
or
trust
to
add
back
75
percent
of
25


such
amount
when
calculating
Iowa
taxable
income.
26


The
bill
provides
special
rules
for
calculating
the
27


qualified
business
income
deduction
in
the
case
of
an
entity
28


filing
an
Iowa
composite
income
tax
return
on
behalf
of
all
of
29


the
entity’s
nonresident
partners,
members,
beneficiaries,
or
30


shareholders.
In
such
cases,
the
deduction
on
the
composite
31


return
shall
be
an
amount
equal
to
25
percent
of
the
federal
32


qualified
business
income
deduction
that
would
be
allowable
to
33


an
individual
reporting
the
same
items
of
income
and
loss
that
34


are
included
on
the
composite
return.

to
be
12


considered
qualified

therefore
eligible
for
certain

federal

allow
contributions
for
the
purposes
of
funding
certain
15


qualifying
expenses
of
attendance
at

Accordingly,
the

allows

17


to
contribute

to

18


for

20


The
federal
Tax

of

amended
IRC

§529
to
provide

during

a

for

and
thus
excludable

for
federal

The
federal

The

certain
transfers
from

program
to
