 22 12    Sec. 45.  TERM OF OFFICE ====  TRANSITION PROVISIONS.
 22 13    1.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 260C.11
 22 14 designating a term of four years for members of a board of
 22 15 directors of a merged area, the term of office for a seat on a
 22 16 board of directors filled at the regular school election held
 22 17 on:
 22 18    a.  September 8, 2015, shall expire November 5, 2019.
 22 19    b.  September 12, 2017, shall expire November 2, 2021.
 22 20    2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 273.8,
 22 21 subsection 1, designating a term of four years for members of
 22 22 a board of directors of an area education agency, the term of
 22 23 office for a seat on a board of directors filled by election
 22 24 in:
 22 25    a.  September 2015 shall expire November 30, 2019.
 22 26    b.  September 2017 shall expire November 30, 2021.
 22 27    3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 274.7
 22 28 designating a term of four years for members of a board of
 22 29 directors of a school district, the term of office for a seat
 22 30 on a board of directors filled at the regular school election
 22 31 held on:
 22 32    a.  September 8, 2015, shall expire November 5, 2019.
 22 33    b.  September 12, 2017, shall expire November 2, 2021.
 22 34                           EXPLANATION
 22 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23  2    This bill changes the date of regular school elections
 23  3 for local school districts, merged areas, and area education
 23  4 agencies and provides for combined administration of city and
 23  5 school elections.
 23  6    Division I of the bill moves the date of the regular school
 23  7 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 23  8 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 23  9 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 23 10 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 23 11 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 23 12 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 23 13 of their election from September to November. The division
 23 14 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 23 15 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 23 16 cities in division II of the bill.
 23 17    Division I takes effect July 1, 2019, and applies to school
 23 18 elections held on or after November 5, 2019.
 23 19    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 23 20 administration of city and school elections by changing
 23 21 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 23 27 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 23 28 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 23 29 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can
 23 30 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 23 31    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 23 32 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 23 33 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 23 34 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 23 35 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 24  1 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 24  2 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 24  3 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 24  4 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 24  5 the election.
 24  6    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 24  7 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 24  8 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 24  9 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 24 10 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 24 11 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 24 12 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 24 13 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 24 14 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 24 15 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 24 16 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 24 17 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 24 18 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 24 21 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 24 22 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 24 23 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 24 24 elections.
 24 25    The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 24 26 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 24 27 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 24 28 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 24 29 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 24 30 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 24 31 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 24 32 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2019.
 24 33    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions
 24 34 related to the terms of office for seats on boards of directors
 24 35 for school districts, merged areas, and area education
 25  1 agencies.

 22 12    Sec. 45.  TERM OF OFFICE ====  TRANSITION PROVISIONS.
 22 13    1.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 260C.11
 22 14 designating a term of four years for members of a board of
 22 15 directors of a merged area, the term of office for a seat on a
 22 16 board of directors filled at the regular school election held

 22 18    a.  September 8, 2015, shall expire November 5, 2019.
 22 19    b.  September 12, 2017, shall expire November 2, 2021.
 22 20    2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 273.8,
 22 21 subsection 1, designating a term of four years for members of
 22 22 a board of directors of an area education agency, the term of
 22 23 office for a seat on a board of directors filled by election
 22 24 in:
 22 25    a.  September 2015 shall expire November 30, 2019.
 22 26    b.  September 2017 shall expire November 30, 2021.
 22 27    3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 274.7
 22 28 designating a term of four years for members of a board of
 22 29 directors of a school district, the term of office for a seat
 22 30 on a board of directors filled at the regular school election
 22 31 held on:
 22 32    a.  September 8, 2015, shall expire November 5, 2019.
 22 33    b.  September 12, 2017, shall expire November 2, 2021.
 22 34                           EXPLANATION
 22 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23  2    This bill changes the date of regular school elections
 23  3 for local school districts, merged areas, and area education
 23  4 agencies and provides for combined administration of city and
 23  5 school elections.
 23  6    Division I of the bill moves the date of the regular school
 23  7 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 23  8 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 23  9 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 23 10 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 23 11 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 23 12 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 23 13 of their election from September to November. The division
 23 14 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 23 15 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 23 16 cities in division II of the bill.
 23 17    Division I takes effect July 1, 2019, and applies to school
 23 18 elections held on or after November 5, 2019.
 23 19    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 23 20 administration of city and school elections by changing
 23 21 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 23 27 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 23 28 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 23 29 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can

 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more

 23 35 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 24  1 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 24  2 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 24  3 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 24  4 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 24  5 the election.
 24  6    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 24  7 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 24  8 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 24  9 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 24 10 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 24 11 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 24 12 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 24 13 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 24 14 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 24 15 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 24 16 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 24 17 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 24 18 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 24 21 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 24 22 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 24 23 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 24 24 elections.
 24 25    The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 24 26 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 24 27 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 24 28 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 24 29 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 24 30 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 24 31 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 24 32 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2019.
 24 33    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions

 23  8 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November

 23 10 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 23 11 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 23 12 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 23 13 of their election from September to November. The division
 23 14 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special

 23 20 administration of city and school elections by changing
 23 21 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under

 22 34                           EXPLANATION
 22 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23  2    This bill changes the date of regular school elections
 23  3 for local school districts, merged areas, and area education
 23  4 agencies and provides for combined administration of city and
 23  5 school elections.
 23  6    Division I of the bill moves the date of the regular school
 23  7 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 23  8 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 23  9 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 23 10 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 23 11 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 23 12 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 23 13 of their election from September to November. The division
 23 14 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 23 15 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 23 16 cities in division II of the bill.
 23 17    Division I takes effect July 1, 2019, and applies to school
 23 18 elections held on or after November 5, 2019.
 23 19    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 23 20 administration of city and school elections by changing
 23 21 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 23 27 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 23 28 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 23 29 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can
 23 30 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 23 31    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 23 32 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 23 33 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 23 34 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 23 35 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 24  1 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 24  2 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 24  3 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 24  4 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 24  5 the election.
 24  6    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 24  7 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 24  8 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 24  9 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 24 10 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 24 11 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 24 12 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 24 13 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 24 14 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 24 15 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 24 16 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 24 17 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 24 18 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 24 21 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 24 22 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 24 23 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 24 24 elections.
 24 25    The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 24 26 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 24 27 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 24 28 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 24 29 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 24 30 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 24 31 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the

 23 15 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 23 16 cities in division II of the bill.
 23 17    Division I takes effect July 1, 2019, and applies to school
 23 18 elections held on or after November 5, 2019.
 23 19    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 23 20 administration of city and school elections by changing
 23 21 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 23 27 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 23 28 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 23 29 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can
 23 30 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 23 31    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 23 32 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 23 33 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 23 34 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 23 35 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 24  1 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 24  2 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 24  3 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 24  4 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 24  5 the election.
 24  6    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 24  7 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 24  8 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 24  9 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 24 10 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 24 11 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 24 12 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 24 13 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 24 14 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 24 15 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 24 16 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 24 17 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 24 18 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 24 21 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 24 22 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 24 23 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 24 24 elections.
 24 25    The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 24 26 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 24 27 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 24 28 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 24 29 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 24 30 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 24 31 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 24 32 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2019.
 24 33    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions

 22 34                           EXPLANATION
 22 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23  2    This bill changes the date of regular school elections
 23  3 for local school districts, merged areas, and area education
 23  4 agencies and provides for combined administration of city and
 23  5 school elections.
 23  6    Division I of the bill moves the date of the regular school
 23  7 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 23  8 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 23  9 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 23 10 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 23 11 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 23 12 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 23 13 of their election from September to November. The division
 23 14 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 23 15 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 23 16 cities in division II of the bill.
 23 17    Division I takes effect July 1, 2019, and applies to school
 23 18 elections held on or after November 5, 2019.
 23 19    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 23 20 administration of city and school elections by changing
 23 21 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 23 27 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 23 28 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 23 29 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can
 23 30 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 23 31    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 23 32 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 23 33 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 23 34 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 23 35 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 24  1 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 24  2 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 24  3 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 24  4 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 24  5 the election.
 24  6    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 24  7 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 24  8 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 24  9 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 24 10 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 24 11 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 24 12 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 24 13 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 24 14 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 24 15 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 24 16 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 24 17 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 24 18 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 24 21 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 24 22 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 24 23 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 24 24 elections.
 24 25    The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 24 26 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 24 27 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 24 28 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 24 29 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 24 30 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 24 31 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 24 32 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2019.
 24 33    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions
 24 34 related to the terms of office for seats on boards of directors
 24 35 for school districts, merged areas, and area education
 25  1 agencies.

 22 27    3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 274.7
 22 28 designating a term of four years for members of a board of
 22 29 directors of a school district, the term of office for a seat
 22 30 on a board of directors filled at the regular school election
 22 31 held on:
 22 32    a.  September 8, 2015, shall expire November 5, 2019.

 22 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23  2    This bill changes the date of regular school elections
 23  3 for local school districts, merged areas, and area education
 23  4 agencies and provides for combined administration of city and
 23  5 school elections.
 23  6    Division I of the bill moves the date of the regular school
 23  7 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 23  8 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 23  9 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 23 10 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 23 11 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 23 12 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 23 13 of their election from September to November. The division
 23 14 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 23 15 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 23 16 cities in division II of the bill.
 23 17    Division I takes effect July 1, 2019, and applies to school
 23 18 elections held on or after November 5, 2019.
 23 19    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 23 20 administration of city and school elections by changing
 23 21 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 23 27 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 23 28 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 23 29 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can
 23 30 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 23 31    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 23 32 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 23 33 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 23 34 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 23 35 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 24  1 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 24  2 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 24  3 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 24  4 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 24  5 the election.
 24  6    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 24  7 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 24  8 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 24  9 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 24 10 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 24 11 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 24 12 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 24 13 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 24 14 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 24 15 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 24 16 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 24 17 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 24 18 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 24 21 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 24 22 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 24 23 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 24 24 elections.
 24 25    The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 24 26 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 24 27 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 24 28 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 24 29 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 24 30 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 24 31 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 24 32 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2019.
 24 33    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions
 24 34 related to the terms of office for seats on boards of directors

 23 14 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 23 15 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 23 16 cities in division II of the bill.
 23 17    Division I takes effect July 1, 2019, and applies to school

 23 22 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 23 23 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 23 24 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 23 25 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 23 26 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under

 23 28 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special

 23 32 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 23 33 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 23 34 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 23 35 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 24  1 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 24  2 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 24  3 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 24  4 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before

 24  6    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 24  7 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 24  8 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 24  9 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 24 10 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 24 11 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 24 12 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 24 13 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 24 14 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 24 15 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 24 16 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 24 17 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 24 18 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 24 19 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 24 20 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 24 21 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 24 22 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 24 23 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff

 24 26 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 24 27 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 24 28 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the

 24 30 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 24 31 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 24 32 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2019.
