  3 18                           EXPLANATION
  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill relates to the criminal offense of invasion of
  3 22 privacy, provides penalties, and makes penalties applicable.
  3 23    Current law provides that a person commits the crime of
  3 24 invasion of privacy, an aggravated misdemeanor, if the person
  3 25 knowingly views, photographs, or films another person, for
  3 26 the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of
  3 27 any person, if all of the following apply:  the other person
  3 28 does not consent or is unable to consent to being viewed,
  3 29 photographed, or filmed; the other person is in a state of
  3 30 full or partial nudity; and the other person has a reasonable
  3 31 expectation of privacy while in a state of full or partial
  3 32 nudity. Under the bill, the current law creating the criminal
  3 33 offense of invasion of privacy is moved to Code section
  3 34 709.21(4), but strikes the requirement that the prosecution
  3 35 prove the victim did not have knowledge about being viewed,
  4  1 photographed, or filmed.
  4  2    The bill creates two additional invasion of privacy criminal
  4  3 offenses in Code section 709.21(2) and (3).
  4  4    New Code section 709.21(2) provides that a person who
  4  5 knowingly disseminates, publishes, distributes, posts, or
  4  6 causes to be disseminated, published, distributed, or posted, a
  4  7 visual depiction showing another person in a state of full or
  4  8 partial nudity or engaged in a sex act, without the consent of
  4  9 the other person commits an invasion of privacy.
  4 10    New Code section 709.21(3) provides that a person who
  4 11 knowingly creates a visual depiction that shows another person
  4 12 in a state of full or partial nudity or engaged in a sex act,
  4 13 if the other person did not or was unable to consent to the
  4 14 creation, commits invasion of privacy.
  4 15    Current law and the bill define "full or partial nudity" to
  4 16 mean the showing of any part of the human genitals or pubic
  4 17 area or buttocks, or any part of the nipple of the breast of a
  4 18 female, with less than fully opaque covering.
  4 19    Current law and the bill define "photographs or films"
  4 20 to mean the making of any photograph, motion picture film,
  4 21 videotape, or any other recording or transmission of the image
  4 22 of a person.
  4 23    The bill defines "visual depiction" to mean the same as
  4 24 defined under Code section 728.1.
  4 25    A "sex act" is defined in Code section 702.17.
  4 26    New Code section 709.21(2) and (3) do not apply to the
  4 27 following: visual depictions involving voluntary exposure in
  4 28 public or commercial settings; or to disclosures made in the
  4 29 public interest, including but not limited to for the reporting
  4 30 of unlawful conduct, or for the lawful and common practices
  4 31 of law enforcement, criminal reporting, legal proceedings, or
  4 32 medical treatment.
  4 33    A person who violates the bill commits an aggravated
  4 34 misdemeanor.  An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by
  4 35 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
  5  1 $625 but not more than $6,250.
  5  2    Under current law and the bill, a person convicted of
  5  3 invasion of privacy in violation of Code section 709.21(4)
  5  4 is required to register as a sex offender under Code chapter
  5  5 692A.  The bill provides that if a person commits invasion of
  5  6 privacy in violation of the new Code section 709.21(2) or (3),
  5  7 the person may be required to register as a sex offender if
  5  8 the fact finder determines, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
  5  9 the violation was sexually motivated pursuant to Code section
  5 10 692A.126.
  5 11    A person who commits invasion of privacy is also subject to
  5 12 a special 10=year sentence, which may include parole, under
  5 13 Code section 903B.2. A person convicted of a violation of Code
  5 14 section 709.21(2) or (3) shall not be sentenced to a 10=year
  5 15 special sentence unless sexual motivation under Code section
  5 16 692A.126 is found.

  3 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 21    This bill relates to the criminal offense of invasion of
  3 22 privacy, provides penalties, and makes penalties applicable.
  3 23    Current law provides that a person commits the crime of
  3 24 invasion of privacy, an aggravated misdemeanor, if the person
  3 25 knowingly views, photographs, or films another person, for
  3 26 the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of
  3 27 any person, if all of the following apply:  the other person
  3 28 does not consent or is unable to consent to being viewed,
  3 29 photographed, or filmed; the other person is in a state of
  3 30 full or partial nudity; and the other person has a reasonable
  3 31 expectation of privacy while in a state of full or partial
  3 32 nudity. Under the bill, the current law creating the criminal
  3 33 offense of invasion of privacy is moved to Code section
  3 34 709.21(4), but strikes the requirement that the prosecution
  3 35 prove the victim did not have knowledge about being viewed,

  4  2    The bill creates two additional invasion of privacy criminal
  4  3 offenses in Code section 709.21(2) and (3).
  4  4    New Code section 709.21(2) provides that a person who

  4  8 partial nudity or engaged in a sex act, without the consent of
  4  9 the other person commits an invasion of privacy.
  4 10    New Code section 709.21(3) provides that a person who
  4 11 knowingly creates a visual depiction that shows another person
  4 12 in a state of full or partial nudity or engaged in a sex act,
  4 13 if the other person did not or was unable to consent to the
  4 14 creation, commits invasion of privacy.
  4 15    Current law and the bill define "full or partial nudity" to
  4 16 mean the showing of any part of the human genitals or pubic
  4 17 area or buttocks, or any part of the nipple of the breast of a
  4 18 female, with less than fully opaque covering.
  4 19    Current law and the bill define "photographs or films"
  4 20 to mean the making of any photograph, motion picture film,
  4 21 videotape, or any other recording or transmission of the image
  4 22 of a person.
  4 23    The bill defines "visual depiction" to mean the same as
  4 24 defined under Code section 728.1.
  4 25    A "sex act" is defined in Code section 702.17.
  4 26    New Code section 709.21(2) and (3) do not apply to the

  5  2    Under current law and the bill, a person convicted of
  5  3 invasion of privacy in violation of Code section 709.21(4)

  4  3 offenses in Code section 709.21(2) and (3).
  4  4    New Code section 709.21(2) provides that a person who
  4  5 knowingly disseminates, publishes, distributes, posts, or
  4  6 causes to be disseminated, published, distributed, or posted, a

  4 12 in a state of full or partial nudity or engaged in a sex act,
  4 13 if the other person did not or was unable to consent to the
  4 14 creation, commits invasion of privacy.
  4 15    Current law and the bill define "full or partial nudity" to
  4 16 mean the showing of any part of the human genitals or pubic
  4 17 area or buttocks, or any part of the nipple of the breast of a

  4 34 misdemeanor.  An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by
  4 35 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least

  5  2    Under current law and the bill, a person convicted of
  5  3 invasion of privacy in violation of Code section 709.21(4)
  5  4 is required to register as a sex offender under Code chapter

  5  7 the person may be required to register as a sex offender if
  5  8 the fact finder determines, beyond a reasonable doubt, that

  5 11    A person who commits invasion of privacy is also subject to
