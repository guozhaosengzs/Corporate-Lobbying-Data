  3 12                           EXPLANATION
  3 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 15    This bill transfers the state geologist from the department
  3 16 of natural resources to the Iowa flood center at the state
  3 17 university of Iowa under the jurisdiction and authority of
  3 18 the state board of regents, and appropriates moneys from the
  3 19 environment first fund to the state board of regents for
  3 20 purposes of the state geological survey.
  3 21    Currently, the director of the department of natural
  3 22 resources appoints and sets the salary of the state geologist.
  3 23 The bill moves this authority to the state board of regents and
  3 24 requires that the person appointed as state geologist hold, at
  3 25 a minimum, a master's degree in geology.
  3 26    The bill combines a number of the state geologist's
  3 27 reporting requirements into one Code section and provides that
  3 28 the geological survey must be published on the state university
  3 29 of Iowa's internet site.
  3 30    Currently, the state geologist is authorized to lease
  3 31 or rent storage space for geological samples and materials
  3 32 with the approval of the director of the department of
  3 33 administrative services. The bill directs the state board of
  3 34 regents to provide sufficient space for such purposes.
  3 35    The bill makes an appropriation to the state board of
  4  1 regents for FY 2018=2019 from the environment first fund and
  4  2 provides that moneys remaining from an appropriation to the
  4  3 department of natural resources from the environment first
