  1  1    Section 1.  DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES == MASTER
  1  2 MATRIX == ADDITIONAL WATER QUALITY CRITERIA.  The department
  1  3 of natural resources shall revise the master matrix as
  1  4 published in 567 IAC ch. 65, Appendix C to include additional
  1  5 criteria in the water subcategory.  The additional criteria
  1  6 shall include environmental practices used to reduce soil
  1  7 erosion and sediment loss, manage nutrients and reduce
  1  8 contributing contaminant loads to receiving surface waters,
  1  9 and improve surface water quality.  The new criteria shall
  1 10 include edge=of=field soil and water conservation practices
  1 11 or edge=of=field erosion control practices, and may include
  1 12 bioreactors connected to field drainage tile lines, saturated
  1 13 buffers, prairie grass strips located in drainage areas,
  1 14 grassed waterways, areas devoted to permanent vegetation cover,
  1 15 or wetlands.
  1 16                           EXPLANATION
  1 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 19    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the department of
  1 20 natural resources to revise the master matrix used to evaluate
  1 21 proposed confinement feeding operation structure sites by
  1 22 including additional criteria in the water subcategory in
  1 23 order to account for environmental practices used to reduce
  1 24 soil erosion and sediment loss, manage nutrients and reduce
  1 25 contributing contaminant loads to receiving surface waters, and
  1 26 improve surface water quality.
  1 27    BACKGROUND == GENERAL.  The bill refers to provisions in
  1 28 the Iowa administrative code that include the master matrix as
  1 29 required in Code section 459.305 of the "Animal Agriculture
  1 30 Compliance Act".  A person constructing a confinement feeding
  1 31 operation structure may first be required to obtain a permit
  1 32 issued by the department (Code section 459.303).  A confinement
  1 33 feeding operation is a location in which agricultural animals
  1 34 are confined and fed in totally roofed structures for 45
  1 35 days or more in any 12=month period and includes associated
  2  1 confinement feeding operation structures such as buildings,
  2  2 manure storage structures, and egg washwater storage structures
  2  3 (Code section 459.102).  A permit is required if a confinement
  2  4 feeding operation would have an animal unit capacity of
  2  5 at least 1,000 animal units, which would equal 2,500 swine
  2  6 weighing over 55 pounds (Code section 459.102), or if the
  2  7 operation uses an unformed manure storage structure (Code
  2  8 section 459.303).
  2  9    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix is a form
  2 10 used as part of a process in which a person applying for a
  2 11 construction permit is awarded points for agreeing to construct
  2 12 the confinement feeding operation structure or use manure
  2 13 management practices in a manner that exceeds specific state
  2 14 law requirements (e.g., a statutory separation distance imposed
  2 15 between the application of manure and a river or stream as
  2 16 specified in Code section 459.314).  The master matrix is
  2 17 comprised of three subcategories including impacts of the
  2 18 confinement feeding operation on air, water, and the community.
  2 19 A county board of supervisors that adopts a construction
  2 20 evaluation resolution may evaluate the completed application
  2 21 and matrix before submitting comments to the department
  2 22 (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to approve or
  2 23 disapprove the application and issue the permit (Code section
  2 24 459.303).

  1 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 19    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the department of
  1 20 natural resources to revise the master matrix used to evaluate
  1 21 proposed confinement feeding operation structure sites by
  1 22 including additional criteria in the water subcategory in
  1 23 order to account for environmental practices used to reduce
  1 24 soil erosion and sediment loss, manage nutrients and reduce
  1 25 contributing contaminant loads to receiving surface waters, and
  1 26 improve surface water quality.
  1 27    BACKGROUND == GENERAL.  The bill refers to provisions in
  1 28 the Iowa administrative code that include the master matrix as
  1 29 required in Code section 459.305 of the "Animal Agriculture
  1 30 Compliance Act".  A person constructing a confinement feeding
  1 31 operation structure may first be required to obtain a permit
  1 32 issued by the department (Code section 459.303).  A confinement
  1 33 feeding operation is a location in which agricultural animals
  1 34 are confined and fed in totally roofed structures for 45
  1 35 days or more in any 12=month period and includes associated
  2  1 confinement feeding operation structures such as buildings,
  2  2 manure storage structures, and egg washwater storage structures
  2  3 (Code section 459.102).  A permit is required if a confinement
  2  4 feeding operation would have an animal unit capacity of
  2  5 at least 1,000 animal units, which would equal 2,500 swine
  2  6 weighing over 55 pounds (Code section 459.102), or if the
  2  7 operation uses an unformed manure storage structure (Code
  2  8 section 459.303).
  2  9    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix is a form
  2 10 used as part of a process in which a person applying for a
  2 11 construction permit is awarded points for agreeing to construct
  2 12 the confinement feeding operation structure or use manure
  2 13 management practices in a manner that exceeds specific state
  2 14 law requirements (e.g., a statutory separation distance imposed
  2 15 between the application of manure and a river or stream as
  2 16 specified in Code section 459.314).  The master matrix is
  2 17 comprised of three subcategories including impacts of the
  2 18 confinement feeding operation on air, water, and the community.
  2 19 A county board of supervisors that adopts a construction
  2 20 evaluation resolution may evaluate the completed application
  2 21 and matrix before submitting comments to the department
  2 22 (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to approve or
  2 23 disapprove the application and issue the permit (Code section

  1  2 MATRIX == ADDITIONAL WATER QUALITY CRITERIA.  The department
  1  3 of natural resources shall revise the master matrix as
  1  4 published in 567 IAC ch. 65, Appendix C to include additional
  1  5 criteria in the water subcategory.  The additional criteria
  1  6 shall include environmental practices used to reduce soil
  1  7 erosion and sediment loss, manage nutrients and reduce
  1  8 contributing contaminant loads to receiving surface waters,
  1  9 and improve surface water quality.  The new criteria shall
  1 10 include edge=of=field soil and water conservation practices
  1 11 or edge=of=field erosion control practices, and may include
  1 12 bioreactors connected to field drainage tile lines, saturated

  1 19    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the department of
  1 20 natural resources to revise the master matrix used to evaluate
  1 21 proposed confinement feeding operation structure sites by

  1 28 the Iowa administrative code that include the master matrix as
  1 29 required in Code section 459.305 of the "Animal Agriculture
  1 30 Compliance Act".  A person constructing a confinement feeding
  1 31 operation structure may first be required to obtain a permit
  1 32 issued by the department (Code section 459.303).  A confinement
  1 33 feeding operation is a location in which agricultural animals
  1 34 are confined and fed in totally roofed structures for 45
  1 35 days or more in any 12=month period and includes associated
  2  1 confinement feeding operation structures such as buildings,
  2  2 manure storage structures, and egg washwater storage structures
  2  3 (Code section 459.102).  A permit is required if a confinement
  2  4 feeding operation would have an animal unit capacity of
  2  5 at least 1,000 animal units, which would equal 2,500 swine
  2  6 weighing over 55 pounds (Code section 459.102), or if the
  2  7 operation uses an unformed manure storage structure (Code
