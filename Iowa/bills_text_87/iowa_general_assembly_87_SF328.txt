  8 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 14    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill prohibits the construction
  8 15 or expansion of an animal feeding operation structure, open
  8 16 feedlot operation structure, animal truck wash effluent
  8 17 structure, or dry bedded confinement feeding operation
  8 18 structure from being constructed or expanded on karst terrain
  8 19 or terrain that drains into a known sinkhole.  The bill
  8 20 prohibits the stockpiling of certain dry or solid manure on
  8 21 such terrain.  The bill also regulates the use of structures
  8 22 or stockpiles existing on such terrain prior to the bill's
  8 23 effective date.  The bill retains or expands vertical
  8 24 separation distances required between the bottom of a structure
  8 25 or stockpile and any underlying limestone, dolomite, or other
  8 26 soluble rock.  The bill requires that a stockpile located
  8 27 on the terrain be kept in a qualified stockpile structure
  8 28 which is a building or other roofed structure (Code section
  8 29 459.102).  It provides for the removal of manure or solids from
  8 30 the stockpile. It also requires that an existing stockpile be
  8 31 discontinued on July 1, 2027, unless the department of natural
  8 32 resources grants a waiver.
  8 33    BACKGROUND == STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND
  8 34 FACILITIES.  An animal feeding operation is a location where
  8 35 agricultural animals are confined for 45 days or more in
  9  1 any 12=month period and includes associated animal feeding
  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 10  1 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 10  2 manure).
 10  3    BACKGROUND == KARST TERRAIN AND SINKHOLES.  Karst terrain is
 10  4 characterized by the presence of bedrock composed of limestone
 10  5 or dolomite near the ground surface which dissolves easily.
 10  6 Such terrain often includes sinkholes which are a depression or
 10  7 hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the ground's surface
 10  8 layer.
 10  9    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  Each of the three Code chapters
 10 10 provide for the imposition and assessment of civil penalties
 10 11 for violations involving water quality.  A person who violates
 10 12 a water quality provision is subject to an administratively
 10 13 assessed civil penalty of not more than $10,000 (Code sections
 10 14 455B.109, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402), or a judicially
 10 15 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 10 16 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).

  7 26 dry bedded manure at the same location so long as the person
  7 27 complies with all of the following:
  7 28    a.  There is a vertical separation distance of at least five
  7 29 feet between the bottom of the stockpile and any underlying
  7 30 limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.
  7 31    b.  The dry bedded manure is stockpiled in a qualified
  7 32 stockpile structure.
  7 33    c.  The person does not expand the volume or weight of
  7 34 stockpiled dry bedded manure.
  7 35    d.  A person stockpiling dry bedded manure shall remove
  8  1 the dry bedded manure and apply it in accordance with the
  8  2 provisions of chapter 459, including section 459.311 within

  8 14    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill prohibits the construction
  8 15 or expansion of an animal feeding operation structure, open
  8 16 feedlot operation structure, animal truck wash effluent
  8 17 structure, or dry bedded confinement feeding operation
  8 18 structure from being constructed or expanded on karst terrain
  8 19 or terrain that drains into a known sinkhole.  The bill
  8 20 prohibits the stockpiling of certain dry or solid manure on
  8 21 such terrain.  The bill also regulates the use of structures
  8 22 or stockpiles existing on such terrain prior to the bill's
  8 23 effective date.  The bill retains or expands vertical
  8 24 separation distances required between the bottom of a structure
  8 25 or stockpile and any underlying limestone, dolomite, or other
  8 26 soluble rock.  The bill requires that a stockpile located
  8 27 on the terrain be kept in a qualified stockpile structure
  8 28 which is a building or other roofed structure (Code section
  8 29 459.102).  It provides for the removal of manure or solids from
  8 30 the stockpile. It also requires that an existing stockpile be
  8 31 discontinued on July 1, 2027, unless the department of natural
  8 32 resources grants a waiver.
  8 33    BACKGROUND == STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND
  8 34 FACILITIES.  An animal feeding operation is a location where
  8 35 agricultural animals are confined for 45 days or more in
  9  1 any 12=month period and includes associated animal feeding
  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 10  1 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 10  2 manure).
 10  3    BACKGROUND == KARST TERRAIN AND SINKHOLES.  Karst terrain is
 10  4 characterized by the presence of bedrock composed of limestone
 10  5 or dolomite near the ground surface which dissolves easily.
 10  6 Such terrain often includes sinkholes which are a depression or
 10  7 hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the ground's surface
 10  8 layer.
 10  9    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  Each of the three Code chapters
 10 10 provide for the imposition and assessment of civil penalties
 10 11 for violations involving water quality.  A person who violates
 10 12 a water quality provision is subject to an administratively
 10 13 assessed civil penalty of not more than $10,000 (Code sections
 10 14 455B.109, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402), or a judicially
 10 15 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 10 16 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).

  7 23    2.  A person who stockpiled dry bedded manure on karst
  7 24 terrain or in an area that drains into a known sinkhole prior
  7 25 to the effective date of this Act may continue to stockpile the
  7 26 dry bedded manure at the same location so long as the person
  7 27 complies with all of the following:
  7 28    a.  There is a vertical separation distance of at least five
  7 29 feet between the bottom of the stockpile and any underlying
  7 30 limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.
  7 31    b.  The dry bedded manure is stockpiled in a qualified
  7 32 stockpile structure.
  7 33    c.  The person does not expand the volume or weight of
  7 34 stockpiled dry bedded manure.
  7 35    d.  A person stockpiling dry bedded manure shall remove
  8  1 the dry bedded manure and apply it in accordance with the
  8  2 provisions of chapter 459, including section 459.311 within
  8  3 six months after the dry bedded manure is first stockpiled.
  8  4 A person shall discontinue stockpiling dry bedded manure at
  8  5 that same location on and after July 1, 2027, unless the
  8  6 person obtains a waiver by the department upon such terms and
  8  7 conditions required by the department.  The department shall
  8  8 only grant a waiver if the department is satisfied that the
  8  9 stockpiled dry bedded manure does not pollute groundwater
  8 10 sources.

  8 18 structure from being constructed or expanded on karst terrain
  8 19 or terrain that drains into a known sinkhole.  The bill
  8 20 prohibits the stockpiling of certain dry or solid manure on
  8 21 such terrain.  The bill also regulates the use of structures
  8 22 or stockpiles existing on such terrain prior to the bill's
  8 23 effective date.  The bill retains or expands vertical
  8 24 separation distances required between the bottom of a structure
  8 25 or stockpile and any underlying limestone, dolomite, or other
  8 26 soluble rock.  The bill requires that a stockpile located
  8 27 on the terrain be kept in a qualified stockpile structure
  8 28 which is a building or other roofed structure (Code section
  8 29 459.102).  It provides for the removal of manure or solids from
  8 30 the stockpile. It also requires that an existing stockpile be
  8 31 discontinued on July 1, 2027, unless the department of natural
  8 32 resources grants a waiver.
  8 33    BACKGROUND == STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND
  8 34 FACILITIES.  An animal feeding operation is a location where
  8 35 agricultural animals are confined for 45 days or more in
  9  1 any 12=month period and includes associated animal feeding
  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 10  1 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 10  2 manure).
 10  3    BACKGROUND == KARST TERRAIN AND SINKHOLES.  Karst terrain is
 10  4 characterized by the presence of bedrock composed of limestone
 10  5 or dolomite near the ground surface which dissolves easily.
 10  6 Such terrain often includes sinkholes which are a depression or
 10  7 hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the ground's surface
 10  8 layer.
 10  9    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  Each of the three Code chapters
 10 10 provide for the imposition and assessment of civil penalties
 10 11 for violations involving water quality.  A person who violates
 10 12 a water quality provision is subject to an administratively
 10 13 assessed civil penalty of not more than $10,000 (Code sections
 10 14 455B.109, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402), or a judicially
 10 15 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 10 16 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).

  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 10  1 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 10  2 manure).
 10  3    BACKGROUND == KARST TERRAIN AND SINKHOLES.  Karst terrain is
 10  4 characterized by the presence of bedrock composed of limestone
 10  5 or dolomite near the ground surface which dissolves easily.
 10  6 Such terrain often includes sinkholes which are a depression or
 10  7 hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the ground's surface
 10  8 layer.
 10  9    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  Each of the three Code chapters
 10 10 provide for the imposition and assessment of civil penalties
 10 11 for violations involving water quality.  A person who violates
 10 12 a water quality provision is subject to an administratively
 10 13 assessed civil penalty of not more than $10,000 (Code sections
 10 14 455B.109, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402), or a judicially
 10 15 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 10 16 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).

  8 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 14    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill prohibits the construction
  8 15 or expansion of an animal feeding operation structure, open
  8 16 feedlot operation structure, animal truck wash effluent
  8 17 structure, or dry bedded confinement feeding operation
  8 18 structure from being constructed or expanded on karst terrain
  8 19 or terrain that drains into a known sinkhole.  The bill
  8 20 prohibits the stockpiling of certain dry or solid manure on
  8 21 such terrain.  The bill also regulates the use of structures
  8 22 or stockpiles existing on such terrain prior to the bill's
  8 23 effective date.  The bill retains or expands vertical
  8 24 separation distances required between the bottom of a structure
  8 25 or stockpile and any underlying limestone, dolomite, or other
  8 26 soluble rock.  The bill requires that a stockpile located
  8 27 on the terrain be kept in a qualified stockpile structure
  8 28 which is a building or other roofed structure (Code section
  8 29 459.102).  It provides for the removal of manure or solids from
  8 30 the stockpile. It also requires that an existing stockpile be
  8 31 discontinued on July 1, 2027, unless the department of natural
  8 32 resources grants a waiver.
  8 33    BACKGROUND == STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND
  8 34 FACILITIES.  An animal feeding operation is a location where
  8 35 agricultural animals are confined for 45 days or more in
  9  1 any 12=month period and includes associated animal feeding
  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which

  8 32 resources grants a waiver.
  8 33    BACKGROUND == STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND
  8 34 FACILITIES.  An animal feeding operation is a location where
  8 35 agricultural animals are confined for 45 days or more in
  9  1 any 12=month period and includes associated animal feeding
  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 10  1 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 10  2 manure).
 10  3    BACKGROUND == KARST TERRAIN AND SINKHOLES.  Karst terrain is
 10  4 characterized by the presence of bedrock composed of limestone
 10  5 or dolomite near the ground surface which dissolves easily.
 10  6 Such terrain often includes sinkholes which are a depression or
 10  7 hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the ground's surface
 10  8 layer.
 10  9    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  Each of the three Code chapters
 10 10 provide for the imposition and assessment of civil penalties
 10 11 for violations involving water quality.  A person who violates
 10 12 a water quality provision is subject to an administratively
 10 13 assessed civil penalty of not more than $10,000 (Code sections
 10 14 455B.109, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402), or a judicially
 10 15 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 10 16 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).

  8 14    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill prohibits the construction
  8 15 or expansion of an animal feeding operation structure, open
  8 16 feedlot operation structure, animal truck wash effluent
  8 17 structure, or dry bedded confinement feeding operation
  8 18 structure from being constructed or expanded on karst terrain
  8 19 or terrain that drains into a known sinkhole.  The bill
  8 20 prohibits the stockpiling of certain dry or solid manure on
  8 21 such terrain.  The bill also regulates the use of structures
  8 22 or stockpiles existing on such terrain prior to the bill's
  8 23 effective date.  The bill retains or expands vertical
  8 24 separation distances required between the bottom of a structure
  8 25 or stockpile and any underlying limestone, dolomite, or other
  8 26 soluble rock.  The bill requires that a stockpile located
  8 27 on the terrain be kept in a qualified stockpile structure
  8 28 which is a building or other roofed structure (Code section
  8 29 459.102).  It provides for the removal of manure or solids from
  8 30 the stockpile. It also requires that an existing stockpile be
  8 31 discontinued on July 1, 2027, unless the department of natural

  8 33    BACKGROUND == STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND
  8 34 FACILITIES.  An animal feeding operation is a location where
  8 35 agricultural animals are confined for 45 days or more in
  9  1 any 12=month period and includes associated animal feeding
  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 10  1 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 10  2 manure).
 10  3    BACKGROUND == KARST TERRAIN AND SINKHOLES.  Karst terrain is
 10  4 characterized by the presence of bedrock composed of limestone
 10  5 or dolomite near the ground surface which dissolves easily.
 10  6 Such terrain often includes sinkholes which are a depression or
 10  7 hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the ground's surface
 10  8 layer.
 10  9    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  Each of the three Code chapters
 10 10 provide for the imposition and assessment of civil penalties
 10 11 for violations involving water quality.  A person who violates
 10 12 a water quality provision is subject to an administratively
 10 13 assessed civil penalty of not more than $10,000 (Code sections

  8 33    BACKGROUND == STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND
  8 34 FACILITIES.  An animal feeding operation is a location where
  8 35 agricultural animals are confined for 45 days or more in
  9  1 any 12=month period and includes associated animal feeding
  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
  9 35 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 10  1 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 10  2 manure).
 10  3    BACKGROUND == KARST TERRAIN AND SINKHOLES.  Karst terrain is
 10  4 characterized by the presence of bedrock composed of limestone
 10  5 or dolomite near the ground surface which dissolves easily.
 10  6 Such terrain often includes sinkholes which are a depression or
 10  7 hole in the ground caused by a collapse of the ground's surface
 10  8 layer.
 10  9    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  Each of the three Code chapters
 10 10 provide for the imposition and assessment of civil penalties
 10 11 for violations involving water quality.  A person who violates
 10 12 a water quality provision is subject to an administratively
 10 13 assessed civil penalty of not more than $10,000 (Code sections
 10 14 455B.109, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402), or a judicially
 10 15 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 10 16 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).

  8 17 structure, or dry bedded confinement feeding operation
  8 18 structure from being constructed or expanded on karst terrain
  8 19 or terrain that drains into a known sinkhole.  The bill
  8 20 prohibits the stockpiling of certain dry or solid manure on
  8 21 such terrain.  The bill also regulates the use of structures
  8 22 or stockpiles existing on such terrain prior to the bill's
  8 23 effective date.  The bill retains or expands vertical
  8 24 separation distances required between the bottom of a structure
  8 25 or stockpile and any underlying limestone, dolomite, or other
  8 26 soluble rock.  The bill requires that a stockpile located
  8 27 on the terrain be kept in a qualified stockpile structure
  8 28 which is a building or other roofed structure (Code section
  8 29 459.102).  It provides for the removal of manure or solids from

  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).

  9  2 operation structures.  The provisions regulating confined
  9  3 agricultural animals are generally included in three related
  9  4 Code chapters.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal Agriculture
  9  5 Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding operations but
  9  6 primarily confinement feeding operations where agricultural
  9  7 animals are confined to areas which are totally roofed. Code
  9  8 chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act for Open
  9  9 Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities") regulates
  9 10 open feedlot operations which are unroofed or partially roofed
  9 11 areas where there is no vegetation, and where settleable solids
  9 12 are separated from liquids; and animal truck wash facilities
  9 13 used to store effluent including solids after truck=trailers
  9 14 or similar vehicles transporting agricultural animals are
  9 15 cleaned. Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture Compliance
  9 16 Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations") regulates
  9 17 special confinement feeding operations (hoop buildings) in
  9 18 which the effluent is exclusively stored on a dry rather
  9 19 than liquid basis.  An animal feeding operation structure
  9 20 refers to a confinement building, manure storage structure,
  9 21 dry bedded confinement feeding operation structure, or egg
  9 22 washwater storage structure (Code chapter 459.102).  An open
  9 23 feedlot operation structure refers to an open feedlot where
  9 24 agricultural animals are maintained, and a basin or other
  9 25 constructed area where effluent and solids are separated
  9 26 (Code section 459A.102).  A dry bedded confinement feeding
  9 27 operation structure refers to a totally roofed building where
  9 28 agricultural animals are maintained or a structure storing dry
  9 29 bedded manure (Code section 459B.102).
  9 30    BACKGROUND == STOCKPILING.  Stockpiling refers to that part
  9 31 of manure or effluent produced by agricultural animals which
  9 32 is "dry" or "solid", meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
  9 33 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
  9 34 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
