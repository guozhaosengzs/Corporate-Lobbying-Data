  2 28 emblem indicating the person has been convicted of an OWI

  3  7 to the intoxicated person's permanent or temporary place of
  3  8 residence. Failure to submit such a plan and procedure to the
  3  9 satisfaction of the division or local authority is grounds for
  3 10 the suspension or revocation of the license or permit of the
  3 11 licensee or permittee, and may result in a civil penalty not
  3 12 to exceed $1,000.
  3 13    The bill also requires an employee or prospective employee
  3 14 of a licensee or permittee to complete or re=complete an
  3 15 alcohol compliance employee training program if the employee,
  3 16 prospective employee, or another employee of the licensee or
  3 17 permittee is convicted of serving alcohol to an intoxicated
  3 18 person or to a person with a driver's license marked with
  3 19 an OWI emblem. The bill requires the person to attend the
  3 20 next available alcohol compliance employee training program
  3 21 taking place within 100 miles of the licensee's or permittee's
  3 22 business.
  3 23    The bill provides that if a person's motor vehicle operating
  3 24 record indicates the person has been convicted of, or the
  3 25 person's driver's license has been revoked for, a violation of

  3 27 influence of alcohol or a drug) or 321J.2A (persons under the
  3 28 age of 21 operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated), the
  3 29 driver's license must contain an OWI emblem designed by the
  3 30 department of transportation that must appear prominently on
  3 31 the back of the license. However, the bill also provides that
  3 32 if the person's operating record no longer indicates the person
  3 33 has been convicted of, or the person's driver's license has
  3 34 been revoked for, a violation of Code section 321J.2 or 321J.2A
  3 35 due to the deletion of such records pursuant to Code section
  4  1 321.12, the person may apply for a replacement driver's license
  4  2 without an OWI emblem.

  2  9 driver's license has been revoked for, a violation of section

  2 11 operating=while=intoxicated emblem designed by the department
  2 12 that shall appear prominently on the back of the license.
  2 13 If the licensee's operating record no longer indicates the
  2 14 licensee has been convicted of, or the licensee's driver's
