Form

1.
Article
I
——
Findings
and
declaration
of
purpose.
4


a.
The
party
states
find
that:
5


(1)
The
health
and
safety
of
the
public
are
affected
by
the
6


degree
of
compliance
with
and
the
effectiveness
of
enforcement
7


activities
related
to
state
nurse
licensure
laws.
8


(2)
Violations
of
nurse
licensure
and
other
laws
regulating
9


the
practice
of
nursing
may
result
in
injury
or
harm
to
the
10


public.
11


(3)
The
expanded
mobility
of
nurses
and
the
use
of
advanced
12


communication
technologies
as
part
of
our
nation’s
health
care
13


delivery
system
require
greater
coordination
and
cooperation
14


among
states
in
the
areas
of
nurse
licensure
and
regulation.
15


(4)
New
practice
modalities
and
technology
make
compliance
16


with
individual
state
nurse
licensure
laws
difficult
and
17


complex.
18


(5)
The
current
system
of
duplicative
licensure
for
nurses
19


practicing
in
multiple
states
is
cumbersome
and
redundant
for
20


both
nurses
and
states.
21


(6)
Uniformity
of
nurse
licensure
requirements
throughout
22


the
states
promotes
public
safety
and
public
health
benefits.
23


b.
The
general
purposes
of
this
compact
are
to:
24


(1)
Facilitate
the
states’
responsibility
to
protect
the
25


public’s
health
and
safety.
26


(2)
Ensure
and
encourage
the
cooperation
of
party
states
in
27


the
areas
of
nurse
licensure
and
regulation.
28


(3)
Facilitate
the
exchange
of
information
between
party
29


states
in
the
areas
of
nurse
regulation,
investigation,
and
30


adverse
actions.
31


(4)
Promote
compliance
with
the
laws
governing
the
practice
32


of
nursing
in
each
jurisdiction.
33


(5)
Invest
all
party
states
with
the
authority
to
hold
34


a
nurse
accountable
for
meeting
all
state
practice
laws
