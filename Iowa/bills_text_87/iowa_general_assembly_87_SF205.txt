 18 30 17A.4.

 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a

 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.

 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I

 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has

 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 25  7 out=of=state patient in this state shall not obtain medical
 25  8 cannabis from a medical cannabis dispensary in this state.
 25  9    USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS ==== SMOKING PROHIBITED.  The bill
 25 10 provides that a patient shall not consume the medical cannabis
 25 11 by smoking the medical cannabis.
 25 12    USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS ==== AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.  The bill
 25 13 provides prosecution immunity for a health care practitioner,
 25 14 a medical cannabis manufacturer, and a medical cannabis

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 21  9    HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION.  The bill provides
 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application
 21 11 for a medical cannabis registration card, if a health care

 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that

 21 17 written certification, the practitioner must also provide
 21 18 explanatory information to the patient about the therapeutic

 21 35 and submits an application and a fee to the department with
 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than
 22  5 August 15, 2017, to consist of nine practitioners representing
 22  6 the fields of neurology, pain management, gastroenterology,

 22 28 unless otherwise protected from disclosure under state
 22 29 or federal law. As a condition for licensure, a medical
 22 30 cannabis manufacturer and a medical cannabis dispensary
 22 31 must be operational by July 1, 2018. The department is
 22 32 directed to consider several factors in determining whether
 22 33 to license a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 22 34 cannabis dispensary.  Each entity submitting an application for
 22 35 licensure shall pay an application fee to the department.

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 25  3 the laws of another state that allows an out=of=state patient
 25  4 to possess or use medical cannabis in the jurisdiction of

 25  6 medical cannabis card issued under the bill, except that an
 25  7 out=of=state patient in this state shall not obtain medical
 25  8 cannabis from a medical cannabis dispensary in this state.

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that

 21 35 and submits an application and a fee to the department with
 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than

 22 29 or federal law. As a condition for licensure, a medical
 22 30 cannabis manufacturer and a medical cannabis dispensary
 22 31 must be operational by July 1, 2018. The department is
 22 32 directed to consider several factors in determining whether
 22 33 to license a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 22 34 cannabis dispensary.  Each entity submitting an application for
 22 35 licensure shall pay an application fee to the department.

 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled

 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50

       rh/rj
 18 23    Sec. 20.  EMERGENCY RULES.  The department may adopt

 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 25  3 the laws of another state that allows an out=of=state patient
 25  4 to possess or use medical cannabis in the jurisdiction of

 25  8 cannabis from a medical cannabis dispensary in this state.

 18 31    Sec. 21.  TRANSITION PROVISIONS.  A medical cannabis

 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 21  9    HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION.  The bill provides
 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application
 21 11 for a medical cannabis registration card, if a health care
 21 12 practitioner determines that the patient whom the health
 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that

 21 17 written certification, the practitioner must also provide
 21 18 explanatory information to the patient about the therapeutic

 21 34 care practitioner to the department on behalf of the patient,
 21 35 and submits an application and a fee to the department with
 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than
 22  5 August 15, 2017, to consist of nine practitioners representing
 22  6 the fields of neurology, pain management, gastroenterology,

 22 29 or federal law. As a condition for licensure, a medical

 22 31 must be operational by July 1, 2018. The department is
 22 32 directed to consider several factors in determining whether
 22 33 to license a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 22 34 cannabis dispensary.  Each entity submitting an application for
 22 35 licensure shall pay an application fee to the department.

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled

 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.
 20  7    DEFINITIONS.  The bill provides the following definitions:

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 24 33 registration card application and renewal fees, and specify
 24 34 and implement procedures that address public safety including
 24 35 security procedures and product quality, safety, and labeling.
 25  1 RECIPROCITY.  The bill provides that a valid medical
 25  2 cannabis registration card, or its equivalent, issued under
 25  3 the laws of another state that allows an out=of=state patient
 25  4 to possess or use medical cannabis in the jurisdiction of
 25  5 issuance shall have the same force and effect as a valid

 25  8 cannabis from a medical cannabis dispensary in this state.

 25 26 defense to the prosecution that the patient has been diagnosed
 25 27 with a debilitating medical condition, used or possessed
 25 28 medical cannabis pursuant to a certification by a health
 25 29 care practitioner, and, for a patient age 18 or older, is
 25 30 in possession of a valid medical cannabis registration
 25 31 card.  The bill provides a similar affirmative defense for a
 25 32 primary caretaker of a patient who has been diagnosed with a
 25 33 debilitating medical condition who is in possession of a valid
 25 34 medical cannabis registration card, and where the primary
 25 35 caregiver's possession of the medical cannabis is on behalf of

 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,

 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or
 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties

 18 31    Sec. 21.  TRANSITION PROVISIONS.  A medical cannabis

 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues
 18 34 in effect as issued for the twelve=month period following
 18 35 its issuance. This Act does not preclude the permit holder
 19  1 from seeking to renew the permit under this Act prior to the
 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 21  9    HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION.  The bill provides
 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application

 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that

 21 35 and submits an application and a fee to the department with
 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than

 22 32 directed to consider several factors in determining whether
 22 33 to license a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 22 34 cannabis dispensary.  Each entity submitting an application for
 22 35 licensure shall pay an application fee to the department.

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who

 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled

 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

       rh/rj
 18 29 published as a notice of intended action as provided in section
 18 30 17A.4.
 18 31    Sec. 21.  TRANSITION PROVISIONS.  A medical cannabis
 18 32 registration card issued under chapter 124D prior to the
 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues
 18 34 in effect as issued for the twelve=month period following
 18 35 its issuance. This Act does not preclude the permit holder
 19  1 from seeking to renew the permit under this Act prior to the
 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 25 23 including but not limited to Code chapters 124 (controlled
 25 24 substances) and 453B (excise tax on unlawful dealing in
 25 25 certain substances), it is an affirmative and complete
 25 26 defense to the prosecution that the patient has been diagnosed

 25 29 care practitioner, and, for a patient age 18 or older, is
 25 30 in possession of a valid medical cannabis registration

 25 34 medical cannabis registration card, and where the primary

 26  6 patient's possession or use of medical cannabis as authorized
 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,
 26 12 produce, package, possess, cultivate, harvest, use, dispense,

 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or
 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties

 26 19 medical cannabis manufacturer or a medical cannabis dispensary
 26 20 shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation

 18 30 17A.4.
 18 31    Sec. 21.  TRANSITION PROVISIONS.  A medical cannabis
 18 32 registration card issued under chapter 124D prior to the
 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues
 18 34 in effect as issued for the twelve=month period following
 18 35 its issuance. This Act does not preclude the permit holder
 19  1 from seeking to renew the permit under this Act prior to the
 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 21  7 has a debilitating medical condition and provides any other
 21  8 relevant information.
 21  9    HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION.  The bill provides
 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application
 21 11 for a medical cannabis registration card, if a health care
 21 12 practitioner determines that the patient whom the health
 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that

 21 17 written certification, the practitioner must also provide
 21 18 explanatory information to the patient about the therapeutic

 21 34 care practitioner to the department on behalf of the patient,
 21 35 and submits an application and a fee to the department with
 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than
 22  5 August 15, 2017, to consist of nine practitioners representing
 22  6 the fields of neurology, pain management, gastroenterology,

 22 20 and 12 medical cannabis dispensaries by December 1, 2017,

 22 28 unless otherwise protected from disclosure under state
 22 29 or federal law. As a condition for licensure, a medical
 22 30 cannabis manufacturer and a medical cannabis dispensary
 22 31 must be operational by July 1, 2018. The department is
 22 32 directed to consider several factors in determining whether
 22 33 to license a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 22 34 cannabis dispensary.  Each entity submitting an application for
 22 35 licensure shall pay an application fee to the department.
 23  1 MEDICAL CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS AND MEDICAL CANNABIS
 23  2 DISPENSARIES ==== ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The operating
 23  3 documents of a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 23  4 cannabis dispensary shall include procedures for oversight and
 23  5 recordkeeping activities of the medical cannabis manufacturer
 23  6 and the medical cannabis dispensary and certain security
 23  7 measures undertaken by the medical cannabis manufacturer
 23  8 and the medical cannabis dispensary.  A medical cannabis

 25 29 care practitioner, and, for a patient age 18 or older, is

       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 18 31    Sec. 21.  TRANSITION PROVISIONS.  A medical cannabis
 18 32 registration card issued under chapter 124D prior to the
 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues
 18 34 in effect as issued for the twelve=month period following
 18 35 its issuance. This Act does not preclude the permit holder
 19  1 from seeking to renew the permit under this Act prior to the
 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.
 20  7    DEFINITIONS.  The bill provides the following definitions:

 21  9    HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION.  The bill provides
 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application
 21 11 for a medical cannabis registration card, if a health care
 21 12 practitioner determines that the patient whom the health
 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that

       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 18 32 registration card issued under chapter 124D prior to the
 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues
 18 34 in effect as issued for the twelve=month period following
 18 35 its issuance. This Act does not preclude the permit holder
 19  1 from seeking to renew the permit under this Act prior to the
 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,
 26 12 produce, package, possess, cultivate, harvest, use, dispense,
 26 13 deliver, transport, supply, or administer medical cannabis if
 26 14 such action is in accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or
 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties
 26 18 provided under Code chapters 124 and 453B.  In addition, a
 26 19 medical cannabis manufacturer or a medical cannabis dispensary
 26 20 shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation

       rh/rj
 18 33 effective date of this Act remains effective and continues
 18 34 in effect as issued for the twelve=month period following
 18 35 its issuance. This Act does not preclude the permit holder
 19  1 from seeking to renew the permit under this Act prior to the
 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and

 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50

 19  2 expiration of the twelve=month period.
 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration

 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50

 19  3                           EXPLANATION
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.
 20  7    DEFINITIONS.  The bill provides the following definitions:
 20  8    "Debilitating medical condition" means cancer, multiple

 20 12 disorder, severe, chronic pain caused by an underlying medical

 20 14 medical condition or its medical treatment approved by the
 20 15 department by rule.
 20 16    "Health care practitioner" means an individual licensed
 20 17 under Code chapter 148 to practice medicine and surgery

 20 30 by the department to manufacture and to possess, cultivate,
 20 31 harvest, transport, package, process, or supply medical

 20 33    "Primary caregiver" means a person, at least 18 years of age,
 20 34 who has been designated by a patient's health care practitioner
 20 35 or a person having custody of a patient, as a necessary
 21  1 caretaker taking responsibility for managing the well=being
 21  2 of the patient with respect to the use of medical cannabis
 21  3 pursuant to the bill.
 21  4    "Written certification" means a document signed by a health
 21  5 care practitioner, with whom the patient has established a
 21  6 patient=provider relationship, which states that the patient
 21  7 has a debilitating medical condition and provides any other
 21  8 relevant information.
 21  9    HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION.  The bill provides
 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application
 21 11 for a medical cannabis registration card, if a health care
 21 12 practitioner determines that the patient whom the health
 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that
 21 16 diagnosis.  If the health care practitioner provides the
 21 17 written certification, the practitioner must also provide
 21 18 explanatory information to the patient about the therapeutic

 21 33 of age, submits a written certification by the patient's health
 21 34 care practitioner to the department on behalf of the patient,
 21 35 and submits an application and a fee to the department with
 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than
 22  5 August 15, 2017, to consist of nine practitioners representing
 22  6 the fields of neurology, pain management, gastroenterology,
 22  7 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,

 22 13 and recommending to the department for approval additional
 22 14 chronic or debilitating diseases or medical conditions or their

 22 16 the use of medical cannabis.
 22 17    MEDICAL CANNABIS MANUFACTURER AND MEDICAL CANNABIS
 22 18 DISPENSARY LICENSURE.  The bill requires the department of
 22 19 public health to license four medical cannabis manufacturers
 22 20 and 12 medical cannabis dispensaries by December 1, 2017,
 22 21 and April 1, 2018, respectively, and to license new medical
 22 22 cannabis manufacturers and new medical cannabis dispensaries
 22 23 or relicense existing medical cannabis manufacturers and new

 22 26 confidential until the medical cannabis manufacturer or the
 22 27 medical cannabis dispensary is licensed by the department
 22 28 unless otherwise protected from disclosure under state
 22 29 or federal law. As a condition for licensure, a medical
 22 30 cannabis manufacturer and a medical cannabis dispensary
 22 31 must be operational by July 1, 2018. The department is
 22 32 directed to consider several factors in determining whether
 22 33 to license a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 22 34 cannabis dispensary.  Each entity submitting an application for
 22 35 licensure shall pay an application fee to the department.
 23  1 MEDICAL CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS AND MEDICAL CANNABIS
 23  2 DISPENSARIES ==== ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The operating

       rh/rj
 19  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.
 20  7    DEFINITIONS.  The bill provides the following definitions:
 20  8    "Debilitating medical condition" means cancer, multiple

 20 11 sclerosis, Ehlers=danlos syndrome, post=traumatic stress
 20 12 disorder, severe, chronic pain caused by an underlying medical
 20 13 condition, and any other chronic or debilitating disease or
 20 14 medical condition or its medical treatment approved by the
 20 15 department by rule.
 20 16    "Health care practitioner" means an individual licensed
 20 17 under Code chapter 148 to practice medicine and surgery
 20 18 or osteopathic medicine and surgery, a physician assistant
 20 19 licensed under Code chapter 148C, or an advanced registered
 20 20 nurse practitioner licensed pursuant to Code chapter 152 or
 20 21 152E.
 20 22    "Medical cannabis" means any species of the genus Cannabis

       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 19  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 25 19 medical cannabis dispensary pursuant to the provisions of the
 25 20 bill.
 25 21    The bill provides that in a prosecution for the unlawful
 25 22 possession of marijuana under the laws of this state,
 25 23 including but not limited to Code chapters 124 (controlled

 25 29 care practitioner, and, for a patient age 18 or older, is
 25 30 in possession of a valid medical cannabis registration
 25 31 card.  The bill provides a similar affirmative defense for a
 25 32 primary caretaker of a patient who has been diagnosed with a
 25 33 debilitating medical condition who is in possession of a valid
 25 34 medical cannabis registration card, and where the primary
 25 35 caregiver's possession of the medical cannabis is on behalf of
 26  1 the patient and for the patient's use only. The bill provides
 26  2 that an agency of this state or a political subdivision
 26  3 thereof, including any law enforcement agency, shall not remove
 26  4 or initiate proceedings to remove a patient under the age of
 26  5 18 from the home of a parent based solely upon the parent's or
 26  6 patient's possession or use of medical cannabis as authorized
 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,
 26 12 produce, package, possess, cultivate, harvest, use, dispense,
 26 13 deliver, transport, supply, or administer medical cannabis if
 26 14 such action is in accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or
 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties
 26 18 provided under Code chapters 124 and 453B.  In addition, a

       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 19  6    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act, reclassifies
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of
 20  6 marijuana involved in the offense.

 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application

 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.

 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than

 22 16 the use of medical cannabis.
 22 17    MEDICAL CANNABIS MANUFACTURER AND MEDICAL CANNABIS
 22 18 DISPENSARY LICENSURE.  The bill requires the department of

 22 28 unless otherwise protected from disclosure under state
 22 29 or federal law. As a condition for licensure, a medical
 22 30 cannabis manufacturer and a medical cannabis dispensary
 22 31 must be operational by July 1, 2018. The department is
 22 32 directed to consider several factors in determining whether
 22 33 to license a medical cannabis manufacturer and a medical
 22 34 cannabis dispensary.  Each entity submitting an application for
 22 35 licensure shall pay an application fee to the department.

 25 29 care practitioner, and, for a patient age 18 or older, is
 25 30 in possession of a valid medical cannabis registration

 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,

       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 19  7 marijuana, including tetrahydrocannabinols, from a schedule I
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 21  7 has a debilitating medical condition and provides any other
 21  8 relevant information.
 21  9    HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION.  The bill provides
 21 10 that prior to a patient's submission of an application
 21 11 for a medical cannabis registration card, if a health care
 21 12 practitioner determines that the patient whom the health
 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a
 21 14 debilitating medical condition, the health care practitioner
 21 15 may provide the patient with a written certification of that
 21 16 diagnosis.  If the health care practitioner provides the
 21 17 written certification, the practitioner must also provide
 21 18 explanatory information to the patient about the therapeutic

 21 34 care practitioner to the department on behalf of the patient,
 21 35 and submits an application and a fee to the department with
 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than
 22  5 August 15, 2017, to consist of nine practitioners representing
 22  6 the fields of neurology, pain management, gastroenterology,

 25 14 a medical cannabis manufacturer, and a medical cannabis
 25 15 dispensary, including any authorized agents or employees of the

 25 29 care practitioner, and, for a patient age 18 or older, is

 25 32 primary caretaker of a patient who has been diagnosed with a
 25 33 debilitating medical condition who is in possession of a valid
 25 34 medical cannabis registration card, and where the primary
 25 35 caregiver's possession of the medical cannabis is on behalf of

 26  6 patient's possession or use of medical cannabis as authorized
 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,
 26 12 produce, package, possess, cultivate, harvest, use, dispense,
 26 13 deliver, transport, supply, or administer medical cannabis if
 26 14 such action is in accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or
 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties
 26 18 provided under Code chapters 124 and 453B.  In addition, a
 26 19 medical cannabis manufacturer or a medical cannabis dispensary
 26 20 shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation

       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 19  8 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance, and
 19  9 provides for civil and criminal penalties and fees.
 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by

 24 17 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 24 18 regulations.
 24 19    ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENT DUTIES ==== RULES.  The bill requires

 19 10    OVERVIEW.  The bill allows a patient with a debilitating
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 21 13 care practitioner has examined and treated suffers from a

 22  1 certain information.  A medical cannabis registration card
 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.
 22  3    MEDICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL.  The director of public health is
 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than
 22  5 August 15, 2017, to consist of nine practitioners representing

 25  3 the laws of another state that allows an out=of=state patient
 25  4 to possess or use medical cannabis in the jurisdiction of

 25  6 medical cannabis card issued under the bill, except that an
 25  7 out=of=state patient in this state shall not obtain medical
 25  8 cannabis from a medical cannabis dispensary in this state.
 25  9    USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS ==== SMOKING PROHIBITED.  The bill

 25 11 by smoking the medical cannabis.
 25 12    USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS ==== AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.  The bill
 25 13 provides prosecution immunity for a health care practitioner,

 25 34 medical cannabis registration card, and where the primary
 25 35 caregiver's possession of the medical cannabis is on behalf of

 26  3 thereof, including any law enforcement agency, shall not remove

 26  5 18 from the home of a parent based solely upon the parent's or
 26  6 patient's possession or use of medical cannabis as authorized
 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,
 26 12 produce, package, possess, cultivate, harvest, use, dispense,
 26 13 deliver, transport, supply, or administer medical cannabis if
 26 14 such action is in accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or
 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties
 26 18 provided under Code chapters 124 and 453B.  In addition, a
 26 19 medical cannabis manufacturer or a medical cannabis dispensary
 26 20 shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation
 26 21 for any violation of the bill in addition to any other
 26 22 applicable penalties.

 26 24 may adopt emergency rules and the rules shall be effective
 26 25 immediately upon filing unless a later date is specified in the
 26 26 rules.
 26 27    TRANSITION PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a medical
 26 28 cannabis registration card issued under Code chapter 124D
 26 29 (medical cannabidiol Act) prior to the effective date of the
 26 30 bill shall remain effective and continues in effect as issued
 26 31 for the 12=month period following its issuance.
       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 19 11 medical condition who receives written certification from
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 26  3 thereof, including any law enforcement agency, shall not remove
 26  4 or initiate proceedings to remove a patient under the age of
 26  5 18 from the home of a parent based solely upon the parent's or
 26  6 patient's possession or use of medical cannabis as authorized
 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled

 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties

 26 20 shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation
 26 21 for any violation of the bill in addition to any other
 26 22 applicable penalties.
 26 23    EMERGENCY RULES.  The bill provides that the department
 26 24 may adopt emergency rules and the rules shall be effective
 26 25 immediately upon filing unless a later date is specified in the
 26 26 rules.
 26 27    TRANSITION PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a medical
 26 28 cannabis registration card issued under Code chapter 124D
 26 29 (medical cannabidiol Act) prior to the effective date of the

 26 31 for the 12=month period following its issuance.
       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 19 12 the patient's health care practitioner that the patient has
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat

 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 26  6 patient's possession or use of medical cannabis as authorized
 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section

       LSB 1406XS (7) 87
       rh/rj
 19 13 a debilitating medical condition and who submits the written
 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 19 14 certification along with an application to the department of
 19 15 public health (department) for a medical cannabis registration
 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50

 25  3 the laws of another state that allows an out=of=state patient
 25  4 to possess or use medical cannabis in the jurisdiction of
 25  5 issuance shall have the same force and effect as a valid
 25  6 medical cannabis card issued under the bill, except that an
 25  7 out=of=state patient in this state shall not obtain medical
 25  8 cannabis from a medical cannabis dispensary in this state.
 25  9    USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS ==== SMOKING PROHIBITED.  The bill

 25 33 debilitating medical condition who is in possession of a valid
 25 34 medical cannabis registration card, and where the primary
 25 35 caregiver's possession of the medical cannabis is on behalf of
 26  1 the patient and for the patient's use only. The bill provides
 26  2 that an agency of this state or a political subdivision
 26  3 thereof, including any law enforcement agency, shall not remove
 26  4 or initiate proceedings to remove a patient under the age of
 26  5 18 from the home of a parent based solely upon the parent's or
 26  6 patient's possession or use of medical cannabis as authorized
 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,
 26 12 produce, package, possess, cultivate, harvest, use, dispense,
 26 13 deliver, transport, supply, or administer medical cannabis if
 26 14 such action is in accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or
 26 16 intentionally possesses or uses medical cannabis in violation
 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties
 26 18 provided under Code chapters 124 and 453B.  In addition, a
 26 19 medical cannabis manufacturer or a medical cannabis dispensary
 26 20 shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation

 19 16 card to allow for the lawful use of medical cannabis to treat
 19 17 the patient's debilitating medical condition.  A patient who
 19 18 is issued a medical cannabis registration card will be able
 19 19 to receive medical cannabis directly from a medical cannabis
 19 20 dispensary operated and licensed in this state.
 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by

 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I

 19 35 with such prescription authority.

 25 29 care practitioner, and, for a patient age 18 or older, is
 25 30 in possession of a valid medical cannabis registration
 25 31 card.  The bill provides a similar affirmative defense for a
 25 32 primary caretaker of a patient who has been diagnosed with a
 25 33 debilitating medical condition who is in possession of a valid
 25 34 medical cannabis registration card, and where the primary
 25 35 caregiver's possession of the medical cannabis is on behalf of

 26  7 under the bill.
 26  8    CONFORMING CODE AMENDMENT.  The bill amends Code section
 26  9 124.401, relating to prohibited acts involving controlled
 26 10 substances, to provide that it is lawful for a person to
 26 11 knowingly or intentionally recommend the use of, process,
 26 12 produce, package, possess, cultivate, harvest, use, dispense,
 26 13 deliver, transport, supply, or administer medical cannabis if
 26 14 such action is in accordance with the provisions of the bill.
 26 15    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a person who knowingly or

 26 17 of the requirements of the bill is subject to the penalties

 19 21    RECLASSIFICATION.  The bill reclassifies marijuana,
 19 22 including tetrahydrocannabinols, as a schedule II controlled
 19 23 substance instead of a schedule I controlled substance and
 19 24 strikes references to the authority of the board of pharmacy to
 19 25 adopt rules for the use of marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols
 19 26 for medicinal purposes.
 19 27    A schedule I controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 28 substance that has no accepted medical use in the United States
 19 29 and a schedule II controlled substance is a highly addictive
 19 30 substance that has an accepted medical use in the United
 19 31 States.  The reclassification of marijuana from a schedule I
 19 32 controlled substance to a schedule II controlled substance
 19 33 would allow a physician to issue a prescription for marijuana
 19 34 under state law. However, federal regulations may conflict
 19 35 with such prescription authority.
 20  1 The penalties remain unchanged for violations involving
 20  2 marijuana under the bill. The penalties under Code section
 20  3 124.401 range from a class "B" felony punishable by up to 50
 20  4 years of confinement to a serious misdemeanor punishable by
 20  5 up to six months of confinement depending on the amount of

 22  2 expires one year after the date of issuance and may be renewed.

 22  4 directed to establish a medical advisory council, no later than
