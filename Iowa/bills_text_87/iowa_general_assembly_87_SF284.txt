  2 34    This bill increases the penalties for eluding a law
  2 35 enforcement vehicle under Code sections 321.279 and 707.6A.
  3  1 Current law provides that the driver of a vehicle commits
  3  2 a serious misdemeanor if the driver willfully fails to bring
  3  3 the vehicle to a stop or otherwise eludes or attempts to
  3  4 elude a marked official law enforcement vehicle. A serious
  3  5 misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at least $315 but not
  3  6 to exceed $1,875 and imprisonment not to exceed one year. The
  3  7 bill increases the penalty to an aggravated misdemeanor and

  3  9 aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at least $625
  3 10 but not to exceed $6,250 and imprisonment not to exceed two
  3 11 years.
  3 12    Current law also provides that the driver of a vehicle

  3 14 to bring the vehicle to a stop or otherwise eludes or attempts
  3 15 to elude a marked official law enforcement vehicle and in doing
  3 16 so exceeds the speed limit by 25 miles per hour or more. The

  3 23 bring the motor vehicle to a stop or otherwise eludes or
  3 24 attempts to elude a marked official law enforcement vehicle;
  3 25 exceeds the speed limit by 25 miles per hour or more; and the
  3 26 driver is participating in a public offense that is a felony,
  3 27 the driver is in violation of Code section 321J.2 (operating

  3 32 vehicles. A class "C" felony is punishable by a fine of at

  4  1 eluding or attempting to elude a pursuing law enforcement
  4  2 vehicle from a class "D" felony to a class "C" felony.
  4  3    Finally, current law provides that a person commits a class
  4  4 "C" felony when the person unintentionally causes the death of
  4  5 another person by eluding or attempting to elude a pursuing law
  4  6 enforcement vehicle. The bill increases the penalty to a class
  4  7 "B" felony. A class "B" felony is punishable by imprisonment
  4  8 not to exceed 25 years.

  4 10 possession of a vehicle suspected to have been operated by
  4 11 person in violation of the bill until final disposition of any

  4 13    Under current law, a violation for eluding a law enforcement
  4 14 vehicle is grounds for mandatory revocation of a person's
  4 15 driver's license or operating privilege, and is included in the
  4 16 list of offenses that contribute to habitual offender status.
