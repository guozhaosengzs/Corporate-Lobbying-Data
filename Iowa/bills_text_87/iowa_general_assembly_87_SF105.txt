  4 20 previous violations.
  4 21    4.  An employer may seek judicial review of an assessment
  4 22 made under subsection 3 by instituting proceedings for judicial
  4 23 review pursuant to chapter 17A.  However, such proceedings must

  4 25 violation or one of the violations occurred and within thirty
  4 26 days of the day on which the employer was notified that an
  4 27 assessment was made. Also, an employer may be required, at
  4 28 the discretion of the district court and upon instituting such
  4 29 proceedings, to deposit the amount assessed with the clerk of
  4 30 the district court. Any moneys so deposited shall either be
  4 31 returned to the employer or be forwarded to the commissioner
  4 32 for deposit in the general fund of the state, depending on the
  4 33 outcome of the judicial review, including any appeal to the
  4 34 supreme court.
  4 35    5.  After the time for seeking judicial review has expired
  5  1 or after all judicial review has been exhausted and the
  5  2 commissioner's assessment has been upheld, the commissioner
  5  3 shall request the attorney general to recover the assessed
  5  4 penalties in a civil action.

  4  6 a civil penalty by serving the employer with notice of such
  4  7 proposal in the same manner as an original notice is served
  4  8 under the rules of civil procedure. Upon service of such

  4 28 the discretion of the district court and upon instituting such
  4 29 proceedings, to deposit the amount assessed with the clerk of
  4 30 the district court. Any moneys so deposited shall either be
  4 31 returned to the employer or be forwarded to the commissioner
  4 32 for deposit in the general fund of the state, depending on the
  4 33 outcome of the judicial review, including any appeal to the
  4 34 supreme court.
  4 35    5.  After the time for seeking judicial review has expired
  5  1 or after all judicial review has been exhausted and the
  5  2 commissioner's assessment has been upheld, the commissioner
  5  3 shall request the attorney general to recover the assessed
