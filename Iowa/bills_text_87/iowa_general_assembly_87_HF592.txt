  7 16 charitable contributions to eligible housing developers or
  7 17 eligible rural housing developers in this state.
  7 18    An "eligible housing developer" is defined in the bill to
  7 19 include an Iowa nonprofit, tax=exempt organization that has
  7 20 been developing single=family housing for at least three years
  7 21 in this state to be sold to low=income households, as defined
  7 22 in the bill, that includes the development of such housing in
  7 23 this state for low=income households as a purpose in its bylaws
  7 24 or other organizational documents, and that agrees to provide
  7 25 EDA with certain information in order to properly verify
  7 26 charitable contributions.  An "eligible housing developer"
  7 27 also includes an Iowa nonprofit, tax=exempt organization whose
  7 28 purpose is to support an organization described above and who
  7 29 redistributes any charitable contributions received on behalf
  7 30 of that eligible housing developer to the developer.
  7 31    An "eligible rural housing developer" is defined in the
  7 32 bill to include an Iowa nonprofit, tax=exempt organization
  7 33 that meets the requirements of an eligible housing developer
  7 34 described above but that additionally has conducted for the
  7 35 last three years at least 51 percent of its housing development
  8  1 activities in Iowa counties with a population of fewer than
  8  2 50,000 as determined by the most recent federal decennial
  8  3 census.
  8  4    An organization must apply to EDA to be certified as an
  8  5 eligible housing developer or an eligible rural housing
  8  6 developer.  A certification by EDA will last for a period of
  8  7 three years, at which time an eligible housing developer or
  8  8 eligible rural housing developer may apply to be recertified.
  8  9 Failure to meet the requirements specified above may cause the
  8 10 organization to lose its certification as an eligible housing
  8 11 developer or eligible rural housing developer, but the loss
  8 12 of such certification does not prohibit an organization from
  8 13 subsequently reapplying to EDA for certification.
  8 14    In order to receive a tax credit for a charitable
  8 15 contribution to an eligible housing developer or eligible rural
  8 16 housing developer, a taxpayer is required to apply to the
  8 17 developer in the manner and form prescribed by EDA on or after
  8 18 the date the charitable contribution is made.  The developer is
  8 19 then required to forward the application to EDA.
  8 20    The tax credit equals 50 percent of the amount of the cash or
  8 21 noncash charitable contribution made to the eligible housing
  8 22 developer or eligible rural housing developer during the tax
  8 23 year.  The minimum amount of charitable contribution that may
  8 24 qualify for the tax credit is $500, but each eligible housing
  8 25 developer or eligible rural housing developer is allowed to
  8 26 set a higher minimum contribution amount.   The bill provides
  8 27 that EDA shall not issue more than $7 million in tax credits
  8 28 per calendar year.  Of that $7 million maximum aggregate
  8 29 amount, 20 percent ($1.4 million) of the tax credits shall
  8 30 be reserved for charitable contributions to eligible rural
  8 31 housing developers.  The maximum amount of tax credits that
  8 32 may be issued per taxpayer for charitable contributions in a
  8 33 tax year is $250,000, or $300,000 if at least 20 percent of
  8 34 the taxpayer's total charitable contributions to the eligible
  8 35 housing development organizations during the tax year were to
  9  1 one or more eligible rural housing developers.
  9  2    The tax credit may be claimed against the individual income
  9  3 tax, the corporate income tax, the franchise tax, the insurance
  9  4 companies tax, and the moneys and credits tax.  To claim a tax
  9  5 credit, a taxpayer must include a tax credit certificate with
  9  6 the taxpayer's tax return.  The tax credit is nonrefundable
  9  7 and nontransferable, but any excess may be carried forward for
  9  8 five tax years.  The amount of the charitable contribution for
  9  9 which the tax credit is claimed shall not be deductible in
  9 10 determining taxable income for state tax purposes.
  9 11    EDA is required to issue tax credits on a first=come,
  9 12 first=served basis until the maximum amount of $7 million
  9 13 per calendar year is reached.  If the amount of tax credit
  9 14 applications exceeds $7 million in a calendar year, EDA
  9 15 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
  9 16 subsequent years to applications on the wait list.
  9 17    The bill requires EDA and the department of revenue to
  9 18 adopt rules as necessary for the implementation of the bill,
  9 19 and requires EDA to publish and submit annual reports to
  9 20 the governor and general assembly containing information as
  9 21 described in the bill.
  9 22    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  9 23 1, 2018, and to charitable contributions to eligible housing
  9 24 developers and eligible rural housing developers on or after
  9 25 that date.

  8 28 per calendar year.  Of that $7 million maximum aggregate
  8 29 amount, 20 percent ($1.4 million) of the tax credits shall
  8 30 be reserved for charitable contributions to eligible rural
  8 31 housing developers.  The maximum amount of tax credits that
  8 32 may be issued per taxpayer for charitable contributions in a

  9  5 credit, a taxpayer must include a tax credit certificate with
  9  6 the taxpayer's tax return.  The tax credit is nonrefundable
  9  7 and nontransferable, but any excess may be carried forward for
  9  8 five tax years.  The amount of the charitable contribution for
  9  9 which the tax credit is claimed shall not be deductible in
  9 10 determining taxable income for state tax purposes.
  9 11    EDA is required to issue tax credits on a first=come,
  9 12 first=served basis until the maximum amount of $7 million
  9 13 per calendar year is reached.  If the amount of tax credit
  9 14 applications exceeds $7 million in a calendar year, EDA
  9 15 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
  9 16 subsequent years to applications on the wait list.
  9 17    The bill requires EDA and the department of revenue to
  9 18 adopt rules as necessary for the implementation of the bill,

  7  7    Sec. 10.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to charitable
  7  8 contributions to eligible housing developers and eligible rural
  7  9 housing developers made on or after January 1, 2018.
  7 10                           EXPLANATION
  7 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 13    This bill creates a homeownership development tax credit
  7 14 that will be administered by the economic development authority
  7 15 (EDA) and that will provide tax credits to taxpayers who make
  7 16 charitable contributions to eligible housing developers or
  7 17 eligible rural housing developers in this state.
  7 18    An "eligible housing developer" is defined in the bill to
  7 19 include an Iowa nonprofit, tax=exempt organization that has
  7 20 been developing single=family housing for at least three years
  7 21 in this state to be sold to low=income households, as defined
  7 22 in the bill, that includes the development of such housing in
  7 23 this state for low=income households as a purpose in its bylaws
  7 24 or other organizational documents, and that agrees to provide
  7 25 EDA with certain information in order to properly verify
  7 26 charitable contributions.  An "eligible housing developer"
  7 27 also includes an Iowa nonprofit, tax=exempt organization whose
  7 28 purpose is to support an organization described above and who
  7 29 redistributes any charitable contributions received on behalf
  7 30 of that eligible housing developer to the developer.
  7 31    An "eligible rural housing developer" is defined in the
  7 32 bill to include an Iowa nonprofit, tax=exempt organization
  7 33 that meets the requirements of an eligible housing developer
  7 34 described above but that additionally has conducted for the
  7 35 last three years at least 51 percent of its housing development
  8  1 activities in Iowa counties with a population of fewer than
  8  2 50,000 as determined by the most recent federal decennial
  8  3 census.
  8  4    An organization must apply to EDA to be certified as an
  8  5 eligible housing developer or an eligible rural housing
  8  6 developer.  A certification by EDA will last for a period of
  8  7 three years, at which time an eligible housing developer or
  8  8 eligible rural housing developer may apply to be recertified.
  8  9 Failure to meet the requirements specified above may cause the
  8 10 organization to lose its certification as an eligible housing
  8 11 developer or eligible rural housing developer, but the loss
  8 12 of such certification does not prohibit an organization from
  8 13 subsequently reapplying to EDA for certification.
  8 14    In order to receive a tax credit for a charitable
  8 15 contribution to an eligible housing developer or eligible rural
  8 16 housing developer, a taxpayer is required to apply to the
  8 17 developer in the manner and form prescribed by EDA on or after
  8 18 the date the charitable contribution is made.  The developer is
  8 19 then required to forward the application to EDA.
  8 20    The tax credit equals 50 percent of the amount of the cash or
  8 21 noncash charitable contribution made to the eligible housing
  8 22 developer or eligible rural housing developer during the tax
  8 23 year.  The minimum amount of charitable contribution that may
  8 24 qualify for the tax credit is $500, but each eligible housing
  8 25 developer or eligible rural housing developer is allowed to
  8 26 set a higher minimum contribution amount.   The bill provides
  8 27 that EDA shall not issue more than $7 million in tax credits
  8 28 per calendar year.  Of that $7 million maximum aggregate
  8 29 amount, 20 percent ($1.4 million) of the tax credits shall
  8 30 be reserved for charitable contributions to eligible rural
  8 31 housing developers.  The maximum amount of tax credits that
  8 32 may be issued per taxpayer for charitable contributions in a
  8 33 tax year is $250,000, or $300,000 if at least 20 percent of
  8 34 the taxpayer's total charitable contributions to the eligible
  8 35 housing development organizations during the tax year were to
  9  1 one or more eligible rural housing developers.
  9  2    The tax credit may be claimed against the individual income
  9  3 tax, the corporate income tax, the franchise tax, the insurance
  9  4 companies tax, and the moneys and credits tax.  To claim a tax
  9  5 credit, a taxpayer must include a tax credit certificate with
  9  6 the taxpayer's tax return.  The tax credit is nonrefundable
  9  7 and nontransferable, but any excess may be carried forward for
  9  8 five tax years.  The amount of the charitable contribution for
  9  9 which the tax credit is claimed shall not be deductible in
  9 10 determining taxable income for state tax purposes.
  9 11    EDA is required to issue tax credits on a first=come,
  9 12 first=served basis until the maximum amount of $7 million
  9 13 per calendar year is reached.  If the amount of tax credit
  9 14 applications exceeds $7 million in a calendar year, EDA
  9 15 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
  9 16 subsequent years to applications on the wait list.

  8  7 three years, at which time an eligible housing developer or
  8  8 eligible rural housing developer may apply to be recertified.
  8  9 Failure to meet the requirements specified above may cause the

  8 18 the date the charitable contribution is made.  The developer is
  8 19 then required to forward the application to EDA.

  8 21 noncash charitable contribution made to the eligible housing
  8 22 developer or eligible rural housing developer during the tax
  8 23 year.  The minimum amount of charitable contribution that may
  8 24 qualify for the tax credit is $500, but each eligible housing
  8 25 developer or eligible rural housing developer is allowed to
  8 26 set a higher minimum contribution amount.   The bill provides
  8 27 that EDA shall not issue more than $7 million in tax credits
  8 28 per calendar year.  Of that $7 million maximum aggregate
  8 29 amount, 20 percent ($1.4 million) of the tax credits shall
  8 30 be reserved for charitable contributions to eligible rural
  8 31 housing developers.  The maximum amount of tax credits that
  8 32 may be issued per taxpayer for charitable contributions in a
  8 33 tax year is $250,000, or $300,000 if at least 20 percent of
  8 34 the taxpayer's total charitable contributions to the eligible
  8 35 housing development organizations during the tax year were to
  9  1 one or more eligible rural housing developers.
  9  2    The tax credit may be claimed against the individual income
  9  3 tax, the corporate income tax, the franchise tax, the insurance
  9  4 companies tax, and the moneys and credits tax.  To claim a tax
  9  5 credit, a taxpayer must include a tax credit certificate with
  9  6 the taxpayer's tax return.  The tax credit is nonrefundable
  9  7 and nontransferable, but any excess may be carried forward for
  9  8 five tax years.  The amount of the charitable contribution for
  9  9 which the tax credit is claimed shall not be deductible in
  9 10 determining taxable income for state tax purposes.
  9 11    EDA is required to issue tax credits on a first=come,
  9 12 first=served basis until the maximum amount of $7 million
  9 13 per calendar year is reached.  If the amount of tax credit
  9 14 applications exceeds $7 million in a calendar year, EDA
  9 15 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
  9 16 subsequent years to applications on the wait list.
  9 17    The bill requires EDA and the department of revenue to
  9 18 adopt rules as necessary for the implementation of the bill,
  9 19 and requires EDA to publish and submit annual reports to
  9 20 the governor and general assembly containing information as
  9 21 described in the bill.

  7 16 charitable contributions to eligible housing developers or

  8  1 activities in Iowa counties with a population of fewer than
