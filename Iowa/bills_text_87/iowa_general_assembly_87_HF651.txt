  9 30                           EXPLANATION
  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    This bill relates to property tax assessments, composition
  9 34 of conference boards, and property tax protests and appeals.
  9 35    In 2005, the property assessment appeal board was
 10  1 established.  The legislation establishing the property
 10  2 assessment appeal board included a future repeal of the board
 10  3 effective July 1, 2013.  This future repeal provision was
 10  4 amended in 2013 to extend the date of the repeal to July 1,
 10  5 2018. In 2015, the future repeal provision was again extended
 10  6 from July 1, 2018, to July 1, 2021.
 10  7    Division I of the bill repeals the property assessment
 10  8 appeal board's future repeal provisions, including the 2013 and
 10  9 2015 amendments to those provisions. The bill also strikes a
 10 10 limitation in Code section 441.37A regarding the assessment
 10 11 years for which the property assessment appeal board may hear
 10 12 appeals.
 10 13    For appeals to the property assessment appeal board for
 10 14 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
 10 15 the bill provides that if the board decides in favor of the
 10 16 property owner or taxpayer and the assessment is reduced,
 10 17 the office of assessor is responsible for a percentage of
 10 18 the reasonable costs of the appeal incurred by the owner or
 10 19 taxpayer that is equal to the percentage reduction in the
 10 20 assessment payable from the assessment expense fund. The bill
 10 21 also provides that the responsibility for the payment of a
 10 22 percentage of the property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
 10 23 reasonable costs by the office of assessor shall not apply
 10 24 to the first appeal to the property assessment appeal board
 10 25 for which the assessment is reduced for the assessment year
 10 26 beginning January 1, 2018, or the first such reduction for a
 10 27 subsequent assessment year if no such reduction is ordered by
 10 28 the board for the assessment year beginning January 1, 2018.
 10 29 The bill also establishes similar provisions for the reasonable
 10 30 costs of the owner or taxpayer related to an appeal to district
 10 31 court for assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
 10 32 2018.
 10 33    Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
 10 34 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments
 10 35 made by local assessors.  The current standard imposes a
 11  1 burden of proof on the complainant attacking the valuation as
 11  2 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.  Only after
 11  3 the complainant, at the protest or appeal proceedings, offers
 11  4 competent evidence by at least two disinterested witnesses
 11  5 that the market value of the property is less than the market
 11  6 value determined by the assessor does the burden of proof shift
 11  7 to the officials or persons seeking to uphold the assessor's
 11  8 valuation.
 11  9    Division II of the bill provides that for assessment years
 11 10 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, when a valuation is
 11 11 protested or appealed by a complainant, the burden of proof
 11 12 shall be upon the office of assessor to demonstrate that
 11 13 such valuation is not excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or
 11 14 capricious.
 11 15    Division III of the bill increases the membership of county
 11 16 and city conference boards by requiring the addition of four
 11 17 elected public members. The four public members are elected
 11 18 on a nonpartisan basis by the applicable voters of the county
 11 19 or city at the general election or regular city election,
 11 20 as applicable. The bill provides that a person seeking
 11 21 election as a public member of a conference board must only
 11 22 file an affidavit of candidacy. Each public member seat on
 11 23 the conference board may only be held by an individual who
 11 24 owns or holds an interest in taxable property located in the
 11 25 appropriate jurisdiction that is classified as residential,
 11 26 agricultural, commercial, or industrial property.  Each of
 11 27 the four property classifications is assigned to one of the
 11 28 four public member seats and designated as such on the ballot.
 11 29 The bill provides that a public member seat is not limited by
 11 30 property classification if that property classification is not
 11 31 present within the jurisdiction.  The four public members each
 11 32 serve a four=year term and may be reelected for additional
 11 33 four=year terms. The four public members each constitute a
 11 34 separate voting unit. A vacancy among the public member seats
 11 35 prior to the expiration of a term is filled by appointment by
 12  1 the remaining public members of the conference board. Such an
 12  2 appointment is for the period until the next pending election.
 12  3    By operation of current Code section 441.3, the addition
 12  4 of the four public members to the conference board results in
 12  5 an additional four appointments to the examining board of the
 12  6 applicable assessing jurisdiction.
 12  7    Division IV of the bill modifies provisions relating to
 12  8 even=numbered assessment years by providing that the assessor
 12  9 shall value and assess or revalue and reassess, as the case
 12 10 may require, any individual real estate parcel that the
 12 11 assessor finds was assessed for more than the value authorized
 12 12 by law or was not listed in the assessment year immediately
 12 13 preceding, and any real estate the assessor finds has changed
 12 14 in value subsequent to January 1 of the preceding real estate
 12 15 assessment year based on buildings erected, improvements made,
 12 16 or buildings or improvements removed in a year after the
 12 17 assessment. The bill also provides that a percentage increase
 12 18 for an even=numbered assessment year shall be applied to all
 12 19 property within the class and shall not be applied only to
 12 20 a subset of the class unless approved by the department of
 12 21 revenue.
 12 22    Division IV of the bill also modifies the grounds upon
 12 23 which a property owner or aggrieved taxpayer may protest
 12 24 an assessment under Code section 441.37.  The bill strikes
 12 25 the grounds in current law that are applicable only to
 12 26 even=numbered assessment years and allows those grounds only
 12 27 authorized for odd=numbered assessment years to be asserted in
 12 28 any assessment year.
 12 29    Division IV of the bill applies to assessment years
 12 30 beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
 12 31    Current Code section 441.41 authorizes the conference board
 12 32 to employ special counsel to assist the city legal department
 12 33 or the county attorney in litigation dealing with assessments.
 12 34 The bill provides that such authority is subject to review and
 12 35 approval by the city legal department or the county attorney,
 13  1 as applicable, and includes situations where the city legal
 13  2 department or county attorney is disqualified because of a
 13  3 conflict of interest.

 10  6 from July 1, 2018, to July 1, 2021.
 10  7    Division I of the bill repeals the property assessment
 10  8 appeal board's future repeal provisions, including the 2013 and
 10  9 2015 amendments to those provisions. The bill also strikes a
 10 10 limitation in Code section 441.37A regarding the assessment
 10 11 years for which the property assessment appeal board may hear
 10 12 appeals.
 10 13    For appeals to the property assessment appeal board for
 10 14 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
 10 15 the bill provides that if the board decides in favor of the
 10 16 property owner or taxpayer and the assessment is reduced,
 10 17 the office of assessor is responsible for a percentage of
 10 18 the reasonable costs of the appeal incurred by the owner or
 10 19 taxpayer that is equal to the percentage reduction in the
 10 20 assessment payable from the assessment expense fund. The bill
 10 21 also provides that the responsibility for the payment of a
 10 22 percentage of the property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
 10 23 reasonable costs by the office of assessor shall not apply
 10 24 to the first appeal to the property assessment appeal board
 10 25 for which the assessment is reduced for the assessment year
 10 26 beginning January 1, 2018, or the first such reduction for a
 10 27 subsequent assessment year if no such reduction is ordered by
 10 28 the board for the assessment year beginning January 1, 2018.
 10 29 The bill also establishes similar provisions for the reasonable
 10 30 costs of the owner or taxpayer related to an appeal to district
 10 31 court for assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
 10 32 2018.
 10 33    Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof

 11  9    Division II of the bill provides that for assessment years
 11 10 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, when a valuation is
 11 11 protested or appealed by a complainant, the burden of proof

 12 22    Division IV of the bill also modifies the grounds upon

  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

 10  5 2018. In 2015, the future repeal provision was again extended
 10  6 from July 1, 2018, to July 1, 2021.
 10  7    Division I of the bill repeals the property assessment
 10  8 appeal board's future repeal provisions, including the 2013 and
 10  9 2015 amendments to those provisions. The bill also strikes a
 10 10 limitation in Code section 441.37A regarding the assessment
 10 11 years for which the property assessment appeal board may hear
 10 12 appeals.
 10 13    For appeals to the property assessment appeal board for
 10 14 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
 10 15 the bill provides that if the board decides in favor of the
 10 16 property owner or taxpayer and the assessment is reduced,
 10 17 the office of assessor is responsible for a percentage of
 10 18 the reasonable costs of the appeal incurred by the owner or
 10 19 taxpayer that is equal to the percentage reduction in the
 10 20 assessment payable from the assessment expense fund. The bill
 10 21 also provides that the responsibility for the payment of a
 10 22 percentage of the property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
 10 23 reasonable costs by the office of assessor shall not apply
 10 24 to the first appeal to the property assessment appeal board
 10 25 for which the assessment is reduced for the assessment year
 10 26 beginning January 1, 2018, or the first such reduction for a
 10 27 subsequent assessment year if no such reduction is ordered by
 10 28 the board for the assessment year beginning January 1, 2018.
 10 29 The bill also establishes similar provisions for the reasonable
 10 30 costs of the owner or taxpayer related to an appeal to district
 10 31 court for assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
 10 32 2018.
 10 33    Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
 10 34 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments
 10 35 made by local assessors.  The current standard imposes a
 11  1 burden of proof on the complainant attacking the valuation as
 11  2 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.  Only after
 11  3 the complainant, at the protest or appeal proceedings, offers
 11  4 competent evidence by at least two disinterested witnesses
 11  5 that the market value of the property is less than the market
 11  6 value determined by the assessor does the burden of proof shift
 11  7 to the officials or persons seeking to uphold the assessor's
 11  8 valuation.
 11  9    Division II of the bill provides that for assessment years
 11 10 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, when a valuation is
 11 11 protested or appealed by a complainant, the burden of proof
 11 12 shall be upon the office of assessor to demonstrate that
 11 13 such valuation is not excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or
 11 14 capricious.
 11 15    Division III of the bill increases the membership of county
 11 16 and city conference boards by requiring the addition of four
 11 17 elected public members. The four public members are elected
 11 18 on a nonpartisan basis by the applicable voters of the county
 11 19 or city at the general election or regular city election,
 11 20 as applicable. The bill provides that a person seeking
 11 21 election as a public member of a conference board must only
 11 22 file an affidavit of candidacy. Each public member seat on
 11 23 the conference board may only be held by an individual who
 11 24 owns or holds an interest in taxable property located in the
 11 25 appropriate jurisdiction that is classified as residential,
 11 26 agricultural, commercial, or industrial property.  Each of
 11 27 the four property classifications is assigned to one of the
 11 28 four public member seats and designated as such on the ballot.
 11 29 The bill provides that a public member seat is not limited by
 11 30 property classification if that property classification is not
 11 31 present within the jurisdiction.  The four public members each
 11 32 serve a four=year term and may be reelected for additional
 11 33 four=year terms. The four public members each constitute a
 11 34 separate voting unit. A vacancy among the public member seats
 11 35 prior to the expiration of a term is filled by appointment by
 12  1 the remaining public members of the conference board. Such an
 12  2 appointment is for the period until the next pending election.
 12  3    By operation of current Code section 441.3, the addition
 12  4 of the four public members to the conference board results in
 12  5 an additional four appointments to the examining board of the
 12  6 applicable assessing jurisdiction.
 12  7    Division IV of the bill modifies provisions relating to
 12  8 even=numbered assessment years by providing that the assessor
 12  9 shall value and assess or revalue and reassess, as the case
 12 10 may require, any individual real estate parcel that the
 12 11 assessor finds was assessed for more than the value authorized
 12 12 by law or was not listed in the assessment year immediately
 12 13 preceding, and any real estate the assessor finds has changed
 12 14 in value subsequent to January 1 of the preceding real estate
 12 15 assessment year based on buildings erected, improvements made,
 12 16 or buildings or improvements removed in a year after the
 12 17 assessment. The bill also provides that a percentage increase
 12 18 for an even=numbered assessment year shall be applied to all
 12 19 property within the class and shall not be applied only to
 12 20 a subset of the class unless approved by the department of
 12 21 revenue.
 12 22    Division IV of the bill also modifies the grounds upon
 12 23 which a property owner or aggrieved taxpayer may protest
 12 24 an assessment under Code section 441.37.  The bill strikes
 12 25 the grounds in current law that are applicable only to
 12 26 even=numbered assessment years and allows those grounds only
 12 27 authorized for odd=numbered assessment years to be asserted in
 12 28 any assessment year.

 12 32 to employ special counsel to assist the city legal department

 12 35 approval by the city legal department or the county attorney,
 13  1 as applicable, and includes situations where the city legal
 13  2 department or county attorney is disqualified because of a

  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    This bill relates to property tax assessments, composition
  9 34 of conference boards, and property tax protests and appeals.
  9 35    In 2005, the property assessment appeal board was
 10  1 established.  The legislation establishing the property
 10  2 assessment appeal board included a future repeal of the board
 10  3 effective July 1, 2013.  This future repeal provision was
 10  4 amended in 2013 to extend the date of the repeal to July 1,
 10  5 2018. In 2015, the future repeal provision was again extended
 10  6 from July 1, 2018, to July 1, 2021.
 10  7    Division I of the bill repeals the property assessment
 10  8 appeal board's future repeal provisions, including the 2013 and
 10  9 2015 amendments to those provisions. The bill also strikes a
 10 10 limitation in Code section 441.37A regarding the assessment
 10 11 years for which the property assessment appeal board may hear
 10 12 appeals.
 10 13    For appeals to the property assessment appeal board for
 10 14 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
 10 15 the bill provides that if the board decides in favor of the
 10 16 property owner or taxpayer and the assessment is reduced,
 10 17 the office of assessor is responsible for a percentage of
 10 18 the reasonable costs of the appeal incurred by the owner or
 10 19 taxpayer that is equal to the percentage reduction in the
 10 20 assessment payable from the assessment expense fund. The bill
 10 21 also provides that the responsibility for the payment of a
 10 22 percentage of the property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
 10 23 reasonable costs by the office of assessor shall not apply
 10 24 to the first appeal to the property assessment appeal board
 10 25 for which the assessment is reduced for the assessment year
 10 26 beginning January 1, 2018, or the first such reduction for a
 10 27 subsequent assessment year if no such reduction is ordered by
 10 28 the board for the assessment year beginning January 1, 2018.
 10 29 The bill also establishes similar provisions for the reasonable
 10 30 costs of the owner or taxpayer related to an appeal to district
 10 31 court for assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
 10 32 2018.
 10 33    Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
 10 34 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments
 10 35 made by local assessors.  The current standard imposes a
 11  1 burden of proof on the complainant attacking the valuation as
 11  2 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.  Only after
 11  3 the complainant, at the protest or appeal proceedings, offers
 11  4 competent evidence by at least two disinterested witnesses
 11  5 that the market value of the property is less than the market
 11  6 value determined by the assessor does the burden of proof shift
 11  7 to the officials or persons seeking to uphold the assessor's
 11  8 valuation.
 11  9    Division II of the bill provides that for assessment years
 11 10 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, when a valuation is
 11 11 protested or appealed by a complainant, the burden of proof
 11 12 shall be upon the office of assessor to demonstrate that
 11 13 such valuation is not excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or
 11 14 capricious.
 11 15    Division III of the bill increases the membership of county
 11 16 and city conference boards by requiring the addition of four
 11 17 elected public members. The four public members are elected
 11 18 on a nonpartisan basis by the applicable voters of the county
 11 19 or city at the general election or regular city election,
 11 20 as applicable. The bill provides that a person seeking
 11 21 election as a public member of a conference board must only
 11 22 file an affidavit of candidacy. Each public member seat on
 11 23 the conference board may only be held by an individual who
 11 24 owns or holds an interest in taxable property located in the
 11 25 appropriate jurisdiction that is classified as residential,
 11 26 agricultural, commercial, or industrial property.  Each of
 11 27 the four property classifications is assigned to one of the
 11 28 four public member seats and designated as such on the ballot.
 11 29 The bill provides that a public member seat is not limited by
 11 30 property classification if that property classification is not
 11 31 present within the jurisdiction.  The four public members each
 11 32 serve a four=year term and may be reelected for additional
 11 33 four=year terms. The four public members each constitute a
 11 34 separate voting unit. A vacancy among the public member seats
 11 35 prior to the expiration of a term is filled by appointment by
 12  1 the remaining public members of the conference board. Such an
 12  2 appointment is for the period until the next pending election.
 12  3    By operation of current Code section 441.3, the addition
 12  4 of the four public members to the conference board results in
 12  5 an additional four appointments to the examining board of the
 12  6 applicable assessing jurisdiction.
 12  7    Division IV of the bill modifies provisions relating to
 12  8 even=numbered assessment years by providing that the assessor
 12  9 shall value and assess or revalue and reassess, as the case
 12 10 may require, any individual real estate parcel that the
 12 11 assessor finds was assessed for more than the value authorized
 12 12 by law or was not listed in the assessment year immediately
 12 13 preceding, and any real estate the assessor finds has changed
 12 14 in value subsequent to January 1 of the preceding real estate
 12 15 assessment year based on buildings erected, improvements made,
 12 16 or buildings or improvements removed in a year after the
 12 17 assessment. The bill also provides that a percentage increase
 12 18 for an even=numbered assessment year shall be applied to all
 12 19 property within the class and shall not be applied only to
 12 20 a subset of the class unless approved by the department of
 12 21 revenue.
 12 22    Division IV of the bill also modifies the grounds upon
 12 23 which a property owner or aggrieved taxpayer may protest
 12 24 an assessment under Code section 441.37.  The bill strikes
 12 25 the grounds in current law that are applicable only to
 12 26 even=numbered assessment years and allows those grounds only
 12 27 authorized for odd=numbered assessment years to be asserted in
 12 28 any assessment year.
 12 29    Division IV of the bill applies to assessment years
 12 30 beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
 12 31    Current Code section 441.41 authorizes the conference board
 12 32 to employ special counsel to assist the city legal department
 12 33 or the county attorney in litigation dealing with assessments.
 12 34 The bill provides that such authority is subject to review and
 12 35 approval by the city legal department or the county attorney,
 13  1 as applicable, and includes situations where the city legal
 13  2 department or county attorney is disqualified because of a

 10  6 from July 1, 2018, to July 1, 2021.
 10  7    Division I of the bill repeals the property assessment
 10  8 appeal board's future repeal provisions, including the 2013 and
 10  9 2015 amendments to those provisions. The bill also strikes a
 10 10 limitation in Code section 441.37A regarding the assessment
 10 11 years for which the property assessment appeal board may hear
 10 12 appeals.
 10 13    For appeals to the property assessment appeal board for
 10 14 assessment years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
 10 15 the bill provides that if the board decides in favor of the

 10 18 the reasonable costs of the appeal incurred by the owner or
 10 19 taxpayer that is equal to the percentage reduction in the
 10 20 assessment payable from the assessment expense fund. The bill
 10 21 also provides that the responsibility for the payment of a
 10 22 percentage of the property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
 10 23 reasonable costs by the office of assessor shall not apply
 10 24 to the first appeal to the property assessment appeal board
 10 25 for which the assessment is reduced for the assessment year
 10 26 beginning January 1, 2018, or the first such reduction for a
 10 27 subsequent assessment year if no such reduction is ordered by
 10 28 the board for the assessment year beginning January 1, 2018.
 10 29 The bill also establishes similar provisions for the reasonable
 10 30 costs of the owner or taxpayer related to an appeal to district
 10 31 court for assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
 10 32 2018.
 10 33    Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof

 11 11 protested or appealed by a complainant, the burden of proof
 11 12 shall be upon the office of assessor to demonstrate that

 11 24 owns or holds an interest in taxable property located in the

 11 26 agricultural, commercial, or industrial property.  Each of
 11 27 the four property classifications is assigned to one of the
 11 28 four public member seats and designated as such on the ballot.
 11 29 The bill provides that a public member seat is not limited by
 11 30 property classification if that property classification is not
 11 31 present within the jurisdiction.  The four public members each
 11 32 serve a four=year term and may be reelected for additional

 12  4 of the four public members to the conference board results in
 12  5 an additional four appointments to the examining board of the
 12  6 applicable assessing jurisdiction.
 12  7    Division IV of the bill modifies provisions relating to

 10  4 amended in 2013 to extend the date of the repeal to July 1,
 10  5 2018. In 2015, the future repeal provision was again extended

 10  7    Division I of the bill repeals the property assessment
 10  8 appeal board's future repeal provisions, including the 2013 and

 10 11 years for which the property assessment appeal board may hear
 10 12 appeals.
 10 13    For appeals to the property assessment appeal board for

 10 15 the bill provides that if the board decides in favor of the
 10 16 property owner or taxpayer and the assessment is reduced,
 10 17 the office of assessor is responsible for a percentage of
 10 18 the reasonable costs of the appeal incurred by the owner or
 10 19 taxpayer that is equal to the percentage reduction in the

 10 23 reasonable costs by the office of assessor shall not apply
 10 24 to the first appeal to the property assessment appeal board
 10 25 for which the assessment is reduced for the assessment year
 10 26 beginning January 1, 2018, or the first such reduction for a
 10 27 subsequent assessment year if no such reduction is ordered by

 11  5 that the market value of the property is less than the market
 11  6 value determined by the assessor does the burden of proof shift

 11 12 shall be upon the office of assessor to demonstrate that
 11 13 such valuation is not excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or
 11 14 capricious.
 11 15    Division III of the bill increases the membership of county
 11 16 and city conference boards by requiring the addition of four
 11 17 elected public members. The four public members are elected
 11 18 on a nonpartisan basis by the applicable voters of the county
 11 19 or city at the general election or regular city election,
 11 20 as applicable. The bill provides that a person seeking
 11 21 election as a public member of a conference board must only
 11 22 file an affidavit of candidacy. Each public member seat on

 11 33 four=year terms. The four public members each constitute a
 11 34 separate voting unit. A vacancy among the public member seats
 11 35 prior to the expiration of a term is filled by appointment by

 12 14 in value subsequent to January 1 of the preceding real estate
 12 15 assessment year based on buildings erected, improvements made,

 11 34 separate voting unit. A vacancy among the public member seats
 11 35 prior to the expiration of a term is filled by appointment by
 12  1 the remaining public members of the conference board. Such an

 12 13 preceding, and any real estate the assessor finds has changed
 12 14 in value subsequent to January 1 of the preceding real estate
 12 15 assessment year based on buildings erected, improvements made,

 12 18 for an even=numbered assessment year shall be applied to all
 12 19 property within the class and shall not be applied only to
 12 20 a subset of the class unless approved by the department of

 11  3 the complainant, at the protest or appeal proceedings, offers
 11  4 competent evidence by at least two disinterested witnesses
 11  5 that the market value of the property is less than the market
 11  6 value determined by the assessor does the burden of proof shift

 11 20 as applicable. The bill provides that a person seeking
 11 21 election as a public member of a conference board must only
 11 22 file an affidavit of candidacy. Each public member seat on
 11 23 the conference board may only be held by an individual who
 11 24 owns or holds an interest in taxable property located in the
 11 25 appropriate jurisdiction that is classified as residential,
 11 26 agricultural, commercial, or industrial property.  Each of
 11 27 the four property classifications is assigned to one of the
 11 28 four public member seats and designated as such on the ballot.
 11 29 The bill provides that a public member seat is not limited by
 11 30 property classification if that property classification is not

 11 32 serve a four=year term and may be reelected for additional
 11 33 four=year terms. The four public members each constitute a
 11 34 separate voting unit. A vacancy among the public member seats
 11 35 prior to the expiration of a term is filled by appointment by
 12  1 the remaining public members of the conference board. Such an
 12  2 appointment is for the period until the next pending election.
 12  3    By operation of current Code section 441.3, the addition
 12  4 of the four public members to the conference board results in

 12 11 assessor finds was assessed for more than the value authorized
 12 12 by law or was not listed in the assessment year immediately
 12 13 preceding, and any real estate the assessor finds has changed
 12 14 in value subsequent to January 1 of the preceding real estate
 12 15 assessment year based on buildings erected, improvements made,
 12 16 or buildings or improvements removed in a year after the
 12 17 assessment. The bill also provides that a percentage increase
 12 18 for an even=numbered assessment year shall be applied to all
 12 19 property within the class and shall not be applied only to
 12 20 a subset of the class unless approved by the department of
 12 21 revenue.
 12 22    Division IV of the bill also modifies the grounds upon
 12 23 which a property owner or aggrieved taxpayer may protest
 12 24 an assessment under Code section 441.37.  The bill strikes

 12 30 beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
 12 31    Current Code section 441.41 authorizes the conference board

 13  1 as applicable, and includes situations where the city legal
 13  2 department or county attorney is disqualified because of a

 10 33    Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
 10 34 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments
 10 35 made by local assessors.  The current standard imposes a
 11  1 burden of proof on the complainant attacking the valuation as
 11  2 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.  Only after
 11  3 the complainant, at the protest or appeal proceedings, offers
 11  4 competent evidence by at least two disinterested witnesses
 11  5 that the market value of the property is less than the market
 11  6 value determined by the assessor does the burden of proof shift
 11  7 to the officials or persons seeking to uphold the assessor's
 11  8 valuation.
 11  9    Division II of the bill provides that for assessment years
 11 10 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, when a valuation is
 11 11 protested or appealed by a complainant, the burden of proof
 11 12 shall be upon the office of assessor to demonstrate that
 11 13 such valuation is not excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or
 11 14 capricious.
 11 15    Division III of the bill increases the membership of county

 11 18 on a nonpartisan basis by the applicable voters of the county
 11 19 or city at the general election or regular city election,
 11 20 as applicable. The bill provides that a person seeking
 11 21 election as a public member of a conference board must only
 11 22 file an affidavit of candidacy. Each public member seat on
 11 23 the conference board may only be held by an individual who
 11 24 owns or holds an interest in taxable property located in the
 11 25 appropriate jurisdiction that is classified as residential,
 11 26 agricultural, commercial, or industrial property.  Each of
 11 27 the four property classifications is assigned to one of the
 11 28 four public member seats and designated as such on the ballot.
 11 29 The bill provides that a public member seat is not limited by
 11 30 property classification if that property classification is not
 11 31 present within the jurisdiction.  The four public members each
 11 32 serve a four=year term and may be reelected for additional
 11 33 four=year terms. The four public members each constitute a
 11 34 separate voting unit. A vacancy among the public member seats
 11 35 prior to the expiration of a term is filled by appointment by
 12  1 the remaining public members of the conference board. Such an
 12  2 appointment is for the period until the next pending election.
 12  3    By operation of current Code section 441.3, the addition
 12  4 of the four public members to the conference board results in
 12  5 an additional four appointments to the examining board of the
 12  6 applicable assessing jurisdiction.
 12  7    Division IV of the bill modifies provisions relating to
 12  8 even=numbered assessment years by providing that the assessor
 12  9 shall value and assess or revalue and reassess, as the case
 12 10 may require, any individual real estate parcel that the
 12 11 assessor finds was assessed for more than the value authorized
 12 12 by law or was not listed in the assessment year immediately
 12 13 preceding, and any real estate the assessor finds has changed
 12 14 in value subsequent to January 1 of the preceding real estate
 12 15 assessment year based on buildings erected, improvements made,
 12 16 or buildings or improvements removed in a year after the
 12 17 assessment. The bill also provides that a percentage increase
 12 18 for an even=numbered assessment year shall be applied to all
 12 19 property within the class and shall not be applied only to
 12 20 a subset of the class unless approved by the department of
 12 21 revenue.
 12 22    Division IV of the bill also modifies the grounds upon
 12 23 which a property owner or aggrieved taxpayer may protest
 12 24 an assessment under Code section 441.37.  The bill strikes
 12 25 the grounds in current law that are applicable only to
