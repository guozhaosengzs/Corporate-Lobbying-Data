  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to

  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered

  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.

  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier

  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health

  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.

  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a

  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional

  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug

  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a
  5 15 coverage exemption that is upheld on appeal shall be considered
  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered
  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.
  5 20    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do

  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United
  5 29 States.
  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a
  5 31 generic or interchangeable biological drug product pursuant to
  5 32 section 155A.32.
  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  2 19 care professional, if all of the following apply:

  3 12    3.  Coverage exemption determination process.
  3 13    a.  To ensure continuity of care, a health carrier, health
  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription

  4  8    (i)  Limits or reduces the maximum coverage of prescription
  4  9 drug benefits.
  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier
  4 12 if the health carrier uses a formulary with tiers.
  4 13    (iv)  Excludes the prescription drug from the formulary.
  4 14    c.  Upon granting of a coverage exemption for a drug
  4 15 prescribed by a covered person's prescribing health care
  4 16 professional, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  4 17 utilization review organization shall authorize coverage no
  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health
  4 19 benefit plan, or than that offered prior to implementation of
  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  5 10 person or covered person's authorized representative and the
  5 11 covered person's prescribing health care professional with
  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the

  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a
  5 31 generic or interchangeable biological drug product pursuant to
  5 32 section 155A.32.
  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.

  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable

  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are

  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 10 drug as required by section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  3 11 Cosmetic Act, as codified in 21 U.S.C. {356c.

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall

  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for

  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.

  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier

  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances

  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered

  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a
  5 15 coverage exemption that is upheld on appeal shall be considered
  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and

  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United

  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a
  5 31 generic or interchangeable biological drug product pursuant to

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or

  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.

  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier

  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered

  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  2 15    a.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  2 16 review organization shall not limit or exclude coverage of
  2 17 a prescription drug for any covered person who is medically
  2 18 stable on such drug as determined by the prescribing health
  2 19 care professional, if all of the following apply:
  2 20    (1)  The prescription drug was previously approved by the
  2 21 health carrier for coverage for the covered person.
  2 22    (2)  The covered person's prescribing health care
  2 23 professional has prescribed the drug for the medical condition
  2 24 within the previous six months.
  2 25    (3)  The covered person continues to be an enrollee of the
  2 26 health benefit plan.
  2 27    b.  Coverage of a covered person's prescription drug, as
  2 28 described in paragraph "a", shall continue through the last day
  2 29 of the covered person's eligibility under the health benefit
  2 30 plan, inclusive of any open enrollment period.

  2 35    (2)  Increasing cost sharing for a covered prescription
  3  1 drug.
  3  2    (3)  Moving a prescription drug to a more restrictive tier if

  3  5 the United States food and drug administration has issued a
  3  6 statement about the drug that calls into question the clinical
  3  7 safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug has
  3  8 notified the United States food and drug administration of a
  3  9 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  3 10 drug as required by section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  3 11 Cosmetic Act, as codified in 21 U.S.C. {356c.
  3 12    3.  Coverage exemption determination process.
  3 13    a.  To ensure continuity of care, a health carrier, health
  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances

  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for

  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3  8 notified the United States food and drug administration of a

  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its

  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional

  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with

  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United
  5 29 States.
  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a
  5 31 generic or interchangeable biological drug product pursuant to

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3  5 the United States food and drug administration has issued a
  3  6 statement about the drug that calls into question the clinical
  3  7 safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug has
  3  8 notified the United States food and drug administration of a
  3  9 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  3 10 drug as required by section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  3 11 Cosmetic Act, as codified in 21 U.S.C. {356c.
  3 12    3.  Coverage exemption determination process.
  3 13    a.  To ensure continuity of care, a health carrier, health
  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or

  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for

  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.
  4  3    (b)  The prescribing health care professional continues
  4  4 to prescribe the drug for the covered person for the medical
  4  5 condition.
  4  6    (c)  In comparison to the discontinued health benefit plan,
  4  7 the new health benefit plan does any of the following:
  4  8    (i)  Limits or reduces the maximum coverage of prescription
  4  9 drug benefits.
  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier
  4 12 if the health carrier uses a formulary with tiers.
  4 13    (iv)  Excludes the prescription drug from the formulary.
  4 14    c.  Upon granting of a coverage exemption for a drug
  4 15 prescribed by a covered person's prescribing health care
  4 16 professional, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  4 17 utilization review organization shall authorize coverage no
  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health
  4 19 benefit plan, or than that offered prior to implementation of
  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  4 24 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  4 25 person  or the covered person's authorized representative and
  4 26 the authorized person's prescribing health care professional
  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  5 10 person or covered person's authorized representative and the
  5 11 covered person's prescribing health care professional with
  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a

  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered
  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  2 19 care professional, if all of the following apply:

  2 21 health carrier for coverage for the covered person.
  2 22    (2)  The covered person's prescribing health care

  2 29 of the covered person's eligibility under the health benefit
  2 30 plan, inclusive of any open enrollment period.

  2 32 paragraph "a" include but are not limited to the following:

  3  4    (4)  Removing a prescription drug from a formulary, unless
  3  5 the United States food and drug administration has issued a
  3  6 statement about the drug that calls into question the clinical
  3  7 safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug has
  3  8 notified the United States food and drug administration of a
  3  9 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  3 10 drug as required by section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  3 11 Cosmetic Act, as codified in 21 U.S.C. {356c.
  3 12    3.  Coverage exemption determination process.
  3 13    a.  To ensure continuity of care, a health carrier, health
  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or

  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review

  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall

  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for

  4  9 drug benefits.
  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier
  4 12 if the health carrier uses a formulary with tiers.

  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered

  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered
  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.
  5 20    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do
  5 21 any of the following:

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 12    3.  Coverage exemption determination process.
  3 13    a.  To ensure continuity of care, a health carrier, health
  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude

  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,

  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the

  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a

  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by

  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.

  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary

  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary

  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with

  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:

  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.
  4  3    (b)  The prescribing health care professional continues

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to

  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3  8 notified the United States food and drug administration of a
  3  9 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the

  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.
  4  3    (b)  The prescribing health care professional continues

  5 24 professional deems medically necessary for the covered person.
  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United
  5 29 States.
  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption

  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.
  4  3    (b)  The prescribing health care professional continues
  4  4 to prescribe the drug for the covered person for the medical
  4  5 condition.
  4  6    (c)  In comparison to the discontinued health benefit plan,

  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier

  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,

  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical
  3 19 exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process
  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.
  4  3    (b)  The prescribing health care professional continues
  4  4 to prescribe the drug for the covered person for the medical
  4  5 condition.
  4  6    (c)  In comparison to the discontinued health benefit plan,

  4  8    (i)  Limits or reduces the maximum coverage of prescription
  4  9 drug benefits.
  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier
  4 12 if the health carrier uses a formulary with tiers.
  4 13    (iv)  Excludes the prescription drug from the formulary.
  4 14    c.  Upon granting of a coverage exemption for a drug
  4 15 prescribed by a covered person's prescribing health care

  4 17 utilization review organization shall authorize coverage no
  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health
  4 19 benefit plan, or than that offered prior to implementation of
  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  4 24 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  4 25 person  or the covered person's authorized representative and
  4 26 the authorized person's prescribing health care professional
  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.

  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  5 10 person or covered person's authorized representative and the

  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered

  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  3 14 plan, or utilization review organization shall provide a
  3 15 covered person and prescribing health care professional with
  3 16 access to a clear and convenient process to request a coverage
  3 17 exemption determination. A health carrier, health plan, or
  3 18 utilization review organization may use its existing medical

  3 20 used shall be easily accessible on the internet site of the
  3 21 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 22 organization.
  3 23    b.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  3 24 review organization shall respond to a coverage exemption
  3 25 determination request within seventy=two hours of receipt. In
  3 26 cases where exigent circumstances exist, a health carrier,
  3 27 health benefit plan, or utilization review organization shall
  3 28 respond within twenty=four hours of receipt. If a response by
  3 29 a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  3 30 organization is not received within the applicable time period,
  3 31 the coverage exemption shall be deemed granted.
  3 32    (1)  A coverage exemption shall be expeditiously granted  for
  3 33 a discontinued health benefit plan if a covered person enrolls
  3 34 in a comparable plan offered by the same health carrier, and
  3 35 all of the following conditions apply:
  4  1    (a)  The covered person is medically stable on a prescription
  4  2 drug as determined by the prescribing health care professional.
  4  3    (b)  The prescribing health care professional continues
  4  4 to prescribe the drug for the covered person for the medical
  4  5 condition.
  4  6    (c)  In comparison to the discontinued health benefit plan,

  4  8    (i)  Limits or reduces the maximum coverage of prescription
  4  9 drug benefits.
  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier
  4 12 if the health carrier uses a formulary with tiers.

  4 14    c.  Upon granting of a coverage exemption for a drug
  4 15 prescribed by a covered person's prescribing health care

  4 17 utilization review organization shall authorize coverage no
  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health

  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  4 24 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  4 25 person  or the covered person's authorized representative and
  4 26 the authorized person's prescribing health care professional
  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to

  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical

  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,

  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the

  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to

  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.

  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary

  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are

  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the

  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that

  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any

  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health
  4 19 benefit plan, or than that offered prior to implementation of

  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.

  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the

  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.

  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage

  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld

  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United
  5 29 States.
  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement
  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health
  4 19 benefit plan, or than that offered prior to implementation of
  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a

  4 25 person  or the covered person's authorized representative and
  4 26 the authorized person's prescribing health care professional
  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the

  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is

  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a

  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the

  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility

  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,

  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the

  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year

  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,

  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health

  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a

  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is

  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered

  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the

  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,

  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,

  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan

  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a

  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code

  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.

  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are

  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the

  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United
  5 29 States.
  5 30    (3)  Requiring a pharmacist to effect a substitution of a

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4  9 drug benefits.
  4 10    (ii)  Increases cost sharing for the prescription drug.
  4 11    (iii)  Moves the prescription drug to a more restrictive tier
  4 12 if the health carrier uses a formulary with tiers.

  4 15 prescribed by a covered person's prescribing health care
  4 16 professional, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  4 17 utilization review organization shall authorize coverage no
  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health
  4 19 benefit plan, or than that offered prior to implementation of
  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,

  4 26 the authorized person's prescribing health care professional
  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  5 10 person or covered person's authorized representative and the
  5 11 covered person's prescribing health care professional with
  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a
  5 15 coverage exemption that is upheld on appeal shall be considered
  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered
  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.
  5 20    4.  Limitations.  This section shall not be construed to do

  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health

  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the

  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan

  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.

  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the

  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.

  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,

  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 14    c.  Upon granting of a coverage exemption for a drug
  4 15 prescribed by a covered person's prescribing health care
  4 16 professional, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  4 17 utilization review organization shall authorize coverage no
  4 18 more restrictive than that offered in a discontinued health
  4 19 benefit plan, or than that offered prior to implementation of
  4 20 restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's formulary
  4 21 after the current plan year began.
  4 22    d.  If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  4 24 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  4 25 person  or the covered person's authorized representative and
  4 26 the authorized person's prescribing health care professional
  4 27 with the reason for denial and information regarding the
  4 28 procedure to appeal the denial. Any determination to deny a
  4 29 coverage exemption may be appealed by a covered person or the
  4 30 covered person's authorized representative.
  4 31    e.  A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  4 32 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization
  5  1 review organization shall uphold or reverse a determination to
  5  2 deny a coverage exemption within twenty=four hours of receipt.
  5  3 If the determination to deny a coverage exemption is not upheld
  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  5 10 person or covered person's authorized representative and the
  5 11 covered person's prescribing health care professional with
  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a
  5 15 coverage exemption that is upheld on appeal shall be considered
  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered
  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.

  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable

  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.

  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical

  5 24 professional deems medically necessary for the covered person.
  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  4 23 coverage exemption, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  4 24 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  4 25 person  or the covered person's authorized representative and

  4 33 deny a coverage exemption within seventy=two hours of receipt
  4 34 of an appeal of denial. In cases where exigent circumstances
  4 35 exist, a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization

  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  5 10 person or covered person's authorized representative and the
  5 11 covered person's prescribing health care professional with
  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a

  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in

  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any

  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,

  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on

  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in

  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are

  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the

  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is

  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a

  5 24 professional deems medically necessary for the covered person.
  5 25    b.  Prevent a health carrier from doing any of the following:
  5 26    (1)  Adding a prescription drug to its formulary.
  5 27    (2)  Removing a prescription drug from its formulary if the
  5 28 drug manufacturer has removed the drug for sale in the United
  5 29 States.

  5 33    5.  Enforcement.  The commissioner may take any enforcement

  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5  4 or reversed on appeal within the applicable time period, the
  5  5 denial shall be deemed reversed and the coverage exemption
  5  6 shall be deemed approved.
  5  7    f.  If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is
  5  8 upheld on appeal, the health carrier, health benefit plan,
  5  9 or utilization review organization shall provide the covered
  5 10 person or covered person's authorized representative and the
  5 11 covered person's prescribing health care professional with
  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a
  5 15 coverage exemption that is upheld on appeal shall be considered
  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered
  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 11 covered person's prescribing health care professional with
  5 12 the reason for upholding the denial on appeal and information
  5 13 regarding the procedure to request external review of the
  5 14 denial pursuant to chapter 514J.  Any denial of a request for a
  5 15 coverage exemption that is upheld on appeal shall be considered
  5 16 a final adverse determination for purposes of chapter 514J and
  5 17 is eligible for a request for external review by a covered
  5 18 person or the covered person's authorized representative
  5 19 pursuant to chapter 514J.

  5 31 generic or interchangeable biological drug product pursuant to

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.

  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary

  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year

  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on

  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the

  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its

  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary

  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or

  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.

  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.

  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,

  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code

  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the

  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health

  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously

  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage

  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical

  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a

  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a

  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is

  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next

  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the

  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a

  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on

  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  5 24 professional deems medically necessary for the covered person.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.

  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered

  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or

  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the

  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in

  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States

  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a

  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is

  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next

  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a

  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage

  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on

  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and

  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's

  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.

  5 34 action under the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance
  5 35 with this section.
  6  1    6.  Applicability.  This section is applicable to a health
  6  2 benefit plan that is delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4                           EXPLANATION
  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to the continuity of care for a covered
  6  8 person and nonmedical switching by health carriers, health
  6  9 benefit plans, and utilization review organizations.
  6 10    The bill defines "nonmedical switching" as a health benefit
  6 11 plan's  restrictive changes to the health benefit plan's
  6 12 formulary after the current plan year has begun or during the
  6 13 open enrollment period for the upcoming plan year, causing a
  6 14 covered person who is medically stable on the covered person's
  6 15 current prescribed drug as determined by the prescribing
  6 16 health care professional, to switch to a less costly alternate
  6 17 prescription drug.
  6 18    The bill provides that during a covered person's eligibility
  6 19 under a health benefit plan, inclusive of any open enrollment
  6 20 period, a health plan carrier, health benefit plan, or
  6 21 utilization review organization shall not limit or exclude
  6 22 coverage of a prescription drug for the covered person if the
  6 23 covered person is medically stable on the drug as determined
  6 24 by the prescribing health care professional, the drug was
  6 25 previously approved by the health carrier for coverage for the
  6 26 person, and the person's prescribing health care professional
  6 27 has prescribed the drug for the covered person's medical
  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next
  7 20 plan year if a covered person enrolls in a comparable plan
  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a
  7 34 coverage exemption, the reason for denial and the procedure
  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are
  8 34 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  8 35 state on or after January 1, 2019.

  6 28 condition within the previous six months. The bill includes,
  6 29 as prohibited limitations or exclusions, reducing the maximum
  6 30 coverage of prescription drug benefits, increasing cost sharing
  6 31 for a covered drug, moving a drug to a more restrictive tier,
  6 32 and removing a drug from a formulary. A prescription drug
  6 33 may, however, be removed from a formulary if the United States
  6 34 food and drug administration issues a statement regarding the
  6 35 clinical safety of the drug, or the manufacturer of the drug
  7  1 notifies the United States food and drug administration of a
  7  2 manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the
  7  3 drug as required by section 506c of the Federal Food, Drug, and
  7  4 Cosmetic Act.
  7  5     The bill requires a covered person and prescribing health
  7  6 care professional to have access to a process to request a
  7  7 coverage exemption determination.  The bill defines "coverage
  7  8 exemption determination" as a determination made by a
  7  9 health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  7 10 organization whether to cover a prescription drug that is
  7 11 otherwise excluded from coverage.
  7 12    A coverage exemption determination request must be approved
  7 13 or denied by the health carrier, health benefit plan, or
  7 14 utilization review organization within 72 hours, or within 24
  7 15 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a determination is
  7 16 not received within the applicable time period the coverage
  7 17 exemption is deemed granted.
  7 18    The bill requires a coverage exemption to be expeditiously
  7 19 granted for a health benefit plan discontinued for the next

  7 21 offered by the same health carrier, and in comparison to the
  7 22 discontinued health benefit plan, the new health benefit plan
  7 23 limits or reduces the maximum coverage for a prescription drug,
  7 24 increases cost sharing for the prescription drug, moves the
  7 25 prescription drug to a more restrictive tier, or excludes the
  7 26 prescription drug from the formulary.
  7 27    If a coverage exemption is granted, the bill requires the
  7 28 authorization of coverage that is no more restrictive than that
  7 29 offered in a discontinued health benefit plan, or than that
  7 30 offered prior to implementation of restrictive changes to the
  7 31 health benefit plan's formulary after the current plan year
  7 32 began.
  7 33    If a determination is made to deny a request for a

  7 35 to appeal the denial must be provided to the requestor. Any
  8  1 determination to deny a coverage exemption may be appealed to
  8  2 the health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review
  8  3 organization.
  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,
  8  6 or within 24 hours if exigent circumstances exist. If a
  8  7 determination is not made within the applicable time period,
  8  8 the denial is deemed reversed and the coverage exemption is
  8  9 deemed approved.
  8 10    If a determination to deny a coverage exemption is upheld on
  8 11 appeal, the reason for upholding the denial and the procedure
  8 12 to request external review of the denial pursuant to Code
  8 13 chapter 514J must be provided to the individual who filed the
  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination
  8 16 for purposes of Code chapter 514J and is eligible for a request
  8 17 for external review by a covered person or the covered person's
  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
  8 21 health carrier that the health care professional deems
  8 22 medically necessary for the covered person.
  8 23    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health carrier
  8 24 from adding a drug to its formulary or removing a drug from its
  8 25 formulary if the drug manufacturer removes the drug for sale in
  8 26 the United States.
  8 27    The bill shall not be construed to require a pharmacist
  8 28 to effect a substitution of a generic or interchangeable
  8 29 biological drug product pursuant to Code section 155A.32.
  8 30    The bill allows the commissioner to take any necessary
  8 31 enforcement action under the commissioner's authority to
  8 32 enforce compliance with the bill.
  8 33    The bill is applicable to health benefit plans that are

  8  4    A determination to uphold or reverse denial of a coverage
  8  5 exemption must be made within 72 hours of receipt of an appeal,

  8 14 appeal. Any denial of a request for a coverage exemption that
  8 15 is upheld on appeal is considered a final adverse determination

  8 18 authorized representative pursuant to Code chapter 514J.
  8 19    The bill shall not be construed to prevent a health care
  8 20 professional from prescribing another drug covered by the
