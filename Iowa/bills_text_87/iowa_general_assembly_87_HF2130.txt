  4 25                           EXPLANATION
  4 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 28    This bill amends Code chapter 633 to conform probate
  4 29 procedures to the standards of the electronic data management
  4 30 system as established by the judicial branch and amends the
  4 31 probate powers of the clerk.  The bill amends Code section
  4 32 633.22, probate powers of clerk, to eliminate the following
  4 33 duties of the clerk.  It eliminates the duty to appoint
  4 34 personal representatives, guardians and conservators for
  4 35 minors, fix and determine the amount of the bond, or waive
  5  1 the same when permitted by law or by will, and the approval
  5  2 of any and all bonds given by fiduciaries in the discharge of
  5  3 their duties.  The bill eliminates the duty to admit wills
  5  4 of decedents to probate, when not contested, and to make
  5  5 necessary orders in relation thereto, including orders to issue
  5  6 commissions to take depositions.  It eliminates the duty to
  5  7 make all necessary orders in relation to the personal effects
  5  8 of a deceased person, where no objection is filed, and perform
  5  9 all other acts within the clerk's jurisdiction, as provided in
  5 10 the probate code.  The bill eliminates the duty to approve,
  5 11 when notice has been waived by all persons interested, of
  5 12 petitions and reports, or joint petitions and reports, in
  5 13 respect to the sale, mortgage, pledge, lease, or exchange of
  5 14 property pursuant to Code sections 633.386 to 633.400.
  5 15    Under Code section 633.22, the clerk retains the power to
  5 16 examine and approve all intermediate and interlocutory accounts
  5 17 and reports of fiduciaries.  However, the bill provides that
  5 18 such power is exercisable under Code chapter 633 and that the
  5 19 clerk may convert and close small estates under Code chapter
  5 20 635.  The clerk continues to have the ability to enter routine
  5 21 scheduling orders in probate matters as established by the
  5 22 chief judge of the judicial district.
  5 23    The bill amends Code section 633.27 to provide that the
  5 24 clerk no longer keeps the probate docket as a book, but rather
  5 25 as an electronic record.  The probate docket must, among other
  5 26 things, name all heirs in intestate estates and the surviving
  5 27 spouse of each deceased intestate, and show whether each
  5 28 person is an adult or a minor, and each person's residence.
  5 29 Currently, the probate docket must include such persons'
  5 30 precise ages, not categorically whether such persons are adults
  5 31 or minors.  The probate docket will no longer be required to
  5 32 indicate the volume and page of a real estate record in light
  5 33 of the nature of electronic records.
  5 34    The bill amends Code section 633.42 to require that the
  5 35 requests for notice include a telephone number.
  6  1 The bill amends Code section 633.82 to require that the
  6  2 designation of an attorney includes the attorney's electronic
  6  3 mail address.
  6  4    The bill amends Code section 633.306 to provide that the
  6  5 probate docket is no longer a book, but rather an electronic
  6  6 record.
  6  7    The bill amends the form and verification requirements of
  6  8 claims in Code section 633.418.  It eliminates the requirement
  6  9 to file forms in duplicate and the instruction to clerks
  6 10 on what to do with the duplicate claim form.  It adds the
  6 11 requirement that the claimant provide a telephone number and
  6 12 electronic mail address.
  6 13    The bill repeals Code section 633.72, which dictates
  6 14 the manner of service for original notices to nonresident
  6 15 fiduciaries.
  6 16    Finally, the bill makes its various sections applicable July
  6 17 1, 2018, to the following: the actions of the clerk of the
  6 18 probate court under Code sections 633.22, 633.27, and 633.306;
  6 19 notices served under Code section 633.72 which is repealed;
  6 20 and probate filings under Code sections 633.42, 633.82, and

  4 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 28    This bill amends Code chapter 633 to conform probate
  4 29 procedures to the standards of the electronic data management
  4 30 system as established by the judicial branch and amends the
  4 31 probate powers of the clerk.  The bill amends Code section
  4 32 633.22, probate powers of clerk, to eliminate the following
  4 33 duties of the clerk.  It eliminates the duty to appoint
  4 34 personal representatives, guardians and conservators for
  4 35 minors, fix and determine the amount of the bond, or waive
  5  1 the same when permitted by law or by will, and the approval
  5  2 of any and all bonds given by fiduciaries in the discharge of
  5  3 their duties.  The bill eliminates the duty to admit wills
  5  4 of decedents to probate, when not contested, and to make
  5  5 necessary orders in relation thereto, including orders to issue
  5  6 commissions to take depositions.  It eliminates the duty to
  5  7 make all necessary orders in relation to the personal effects
  5  8 of a deceased person, where no objection is filed, and perform
  5  9 all other acts within the clerk's jurisdiction, as provided in
  5 10 the probate code.  The bill eliminates the duty to approve,
  5 11 when notice has been waived by all persons interested, of
  5 12 petitions and reports, or joint petitions and reports, in
  5 13 respect to the sale, mortgage, pledge, lease, or exchange of
  5 14 property pursuant to Code sections 633.386 to 633.400.
  5 15    Under Code section 633.22, the clerk retains the power to
  5 16 examine and approve all intermediate and interlocutory accounts
  5 17 and reports of fiduciaries.  However, the bill provides that
  5 18 such power is exercisable under Code chapter 633 and that the
  5 19 clerk may convert and close small estates under Code chapter
  5 20 635.  The clerk continues to have the ability to enter routine
  5 21 scheduling orders in probate matters as established by the
  5 22 chief judge of the judicial district.
  5 23    The bill amends Code section 633.27 to provide that the
  5 24 clerk no longer keeps the probate docket as a book, but rather
  5 25 as an electronic record.  The probate docket must, among other
  5 26 things, name all heirs in intestate estates and the surviving
  5 27 spouse of each deceased intestate, and show whether each
  5 28 person is an adult or a minor, and each person's residence.
  5 29 Currently, the probate docket must include such persons'
  5 30 precise ages, not categorically whether such persons are adults
  5 31 or minors.  The probate docket will no longer be required to
  5 32 indicate the volume and page of a real estate record in light
  5 33 of the nature of electronic records.
  5 34    The bill amends Code section 633.42 to require that the
  5 35 requests for notice include a telephone number.
  6  1 The bill amends Code section 633.82 to require that the
  6  2 designation of an attorney includes the attorney's electronic
  6  3 mail address.
  6  4    The bill amends Code section 633.306 to provide that the
  6  5 probate docket is no longer a book, but rather an electronic
  6  6 record.
  6  7    The bill amends the form and verification requirements of
  6  8 claims in Code section 633.418.  It eliminates the requirement
  6  9 to file forms in duplicate and the instruction to clerks
  6 10 on what to do with the duplicate claim form.  It adds the
  6 11 requirement that the claimant provide a telephone number and
  6 12 electronic mail address.
  6 13    The bill repeals Code section 633.72, which dictates
  6 14 the manner of service for original notices to nonresident
  6 15 fiduciaries.
  6 16    Finally, the bill makes its various sections applicable July
  6 17 1, 2018, to the following: the actions of the clerk of the
  6 18 probate court under Code sections 633.22, 633.27, and 633.306;

  4 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 28    This bill amends Code chapter 633 to conform probate
  4 29 procedures to the standards of the electronic data management
  4 30 system as established by the judicial branch and amends the
  4 31 probate powers of the clerk.  The bill amends Code section
  4 32 633.22, probate powers of clerk, to eliminate the following
  4 33 duties of the clerk.  It eliminates the duty to appoint
  4 34 personal representatives, guardians and conservators for
  4 35 minors, fix and determine the amount of the bond, or waive
  5  1 the same when permitted by law or by will, and the approval
  5  2 of any and all bonds given by fiduciaries in the discharge of
  5  3 their duties.  The bill eliminates the duty to admit wills
  5  4 of decedents to probate, when not contested, and to make
  5  5 necessary orders in relation thereto, including orders to issue
  5  6 commissions to take depositions.  It eliminates the duty to
  5  7 make all necessary orders in relation to the personal effects
  5  8 of a deceased person, where no objection is filed, and perform
  5  9 all other acts within the clerk's jurisdiction, as provided in
  5 10 the probate code.  The bill eliminates the duty to approve,
  5 11 when notice has been waived by all persons interested, of
  5 12 petitions and reports, or joint petitions and reports, in
  5 13 respect to the sale, mortgage, pledge, lease, or exchange of
  5 14 property pursuant to Code sections 633.386 to 633.400.
  5 15    Under Code section 633.22, the clerk retains the power to
  5 16 examine and approve all intermediate and interlocutory accounts
  5 17 and reports of fiduciaries.  However, the bill provides that
  5 18 such power is exercisable under Code chapter 633 and that the
  5 19 clerk may convert and close small estates under Code chapter
  5 20 635.  The clerk continues to have the ability to enter routine
  5 21 scheduling orders in probate matters as established by the
  5 22 chief judge of the judicial district.
  5 23    The bill amends Code section 633.27 to provide that the
  5 24 clerk no longer keeps the probate docket as a book, but rather
  5 25 as an electronic record.  The probate docket must, among other
  5 26 things, name all heirs in intestate estates and the surviving
  5 27 spouse of each deceased intestate, and show whether each
  5 28 person is an adult or a minor, and each person's residence.
  5 29 Currently, the probate docket must include such persons'
  5 30 precise ages, not categorically whether such persons are adults
  5 31 or minors.  The probate docket will no longer be required to
  5 32 indicate the volume and page of a real estate record in light
  5 33 of the nature of electronic records.
  5 34    The bill amends Code section 633.42 to require that the
  5 35 requests for notice include a telephone number.
  6  1 The bill amends Code section 633.82 to require that the
  6  2 designation of an attorney includes the attorney's electronic
  6  3 mail address.
  6  4    The bill amends Code section 633.306 to provide that the
  6  5 probate docket is no longer a book, but rather an electronic
  6  6 record.
  6  7    The bill amends the form and verification requirements of
  6  8 claims in Code section 633.418.  It eliminates the requirement
  6  9 to file forms in duplicate and the instruction to clerks
  6 10 on what to do with the duplicate claim form.  It adds the
  6 11 requirement that the claimant provide a telephone number and
  6 12 electronic mail address.
  6 13    The bill repeals Code section 633.72, which dictates
  6 14 the manner of service for original notices to nonresident
  6 15 fiduciaries.
  6 16    Finally, the bill makes its various sections applicable July
  6 17 1, 2018, to the following: the actions of the clerk of the
  6 18 probate court under Code sections 633.22, 633.27, and 633.306;
