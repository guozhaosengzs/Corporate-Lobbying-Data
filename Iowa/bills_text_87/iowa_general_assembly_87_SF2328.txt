  4  5 public utilities. This section does not apply to the
  4  6 acquisition of such utilities by non=rate=regulated entities

  4  8    2.  a.  A public utility shall not acquire, in whole or in
  4  9 part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water utility with a
  4 10 fair market value of five hundred thousand dollars or more
  4 11 from a non=rate=regulated entity described in section 476.1,

  4 28 market value of the acquired utility as established pursuant
  4 29 to section 388.2A, subsection 2, shall be used in determining
  4 30 the applicable ratemaking principles. In determining the
  4 31 applicable ratemaking principles, the board shall not be
  4 32 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or traditional
  4 33 cost recovery mechanisms. Among the principles and mechanisms
  4 34 the board may consider, the board has the authority to approve
  4 35 ratemaking principles that provide for reasonable restrictions
  5  1 upon the ability of the public utility to seek an increase
  5  2 in specified regulated rates for a period of time after the

  5  5 the board shall find that the proposed acquisition will result
  5  6 in just and reasonable rates to all customers of the public
  5  7 utility, including but not limited to existing customers of the
  5  8 public utility. In making this finding, the board may consider
  5  9 any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates,
  5 10 including but not limited to the price paid for the acquired
  5 11 utility and the projected cost of reasonable and prudent
  5 12 changes to the acquired utility in order to provide adequate
  5 13 services and facilities to customers. The board shall consider
  5 14 whether there are ratemaking principles that will result in
  5 15 just and reasonable rates to all customers in determining
  5 16 whether to approve or disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  5 17    e.  Upon the approval of a proposal for acquisition by
  5 18 board order, the parties subject to the acquisition shall
  5 19 have the option of either proceeding with such acquisition or
  5 20 not, subject to any termination provisions contained in the
  5 21 acquisition agreement.
  5 22    f.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
  5 23 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the board
  5 24 pursuant to this section shall be binding with regard to the
  5 25 acquired utility in any subsequent rate proceeding.

  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.

  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the

  4  7 described in section 476.1, subsection 5.
  4  8    2.  a.  A public utility shall not acquire, in whole or in
  4  9 part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water utility with a
  4 10 fair market value of five hundred thousand dollars or more
  4 11 from a non=rate=regulated entity described in section 476.1,
  4 12 subsection 5, unless the board first approves the acquisition.
  4 13 In addition, if the utility to be acquired is a city utility,
  4 14 then the public utility shall not acquire the city utility
  4 15 until the city has first met the requirements of section
  4 16 388.2A.
  4 17    b.  If a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water utility that
  4 18 is the subject of an acquisition meets the requirements of
  4 19 paragraph "a", then the acquiring public utility may apply to
  4 20 the board, prior to the completion of the acquisition, for
  4 21 advance approval of a proposed initial tariff for providing
  4 22 service to customers of the acquired utility.
  4 23    c.  As part of its review of the proposed acquisition,
  4 24 the board shall specify in advance, by order issued after a
  4 25 contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles that will

  4 28 market value of the acquired utility as established pursuant
  4 29 to section 388.2A, subsection 2, shall be used in determining
  4 30 the applicable ratemaking principles. In determining the
  4 31 applicable ratemaking principles, the board shall not be
  4 32 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or traditional

  5  5 the board shall find that the proposed acquisition will result
  5  6 in just and reasonable rates to all customers of the public
  5  7 utility, including but not limited to existing customers of the
  5  8 public utility. In making this finding, the board may consider
  5  9 any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates,
  5 10 including but not limited to the price paid for the acquired
  5 11 utility and the projected cost of reasonable and prudent
  5 12 changes to the acquired utility in order to provide adequate
  5 13 services and facilities to customers. The board shall consider
  5 14 whether there are ratemaking principles that will result in
  5 15 just and reasonable rates to all customers in determining
  5 16 whether to approve or disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  5 17    e.  Upon the approval of a proposal for acquisition by
  5 18 board order, the parties subject to the acquisition shall
  5 19 have the option of either proceeding with such acquisition or
  5 20 not, subject to any termination provisions contained in the
  5 21 acquisition agreement.
  5 22    f.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
  5 23 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the board
  5 24 pursuant to this section shall be binding with regard to the
  5 25 acquired utility in any subsequent rate proceeding.

  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the
  7 15 requirements for the disposal of city utilities by sale, as
  7 16 specified in the bill, before such acquisition.
  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the

  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility
  7 28 shall be used in determining the applicable ratemaking
  7 29 principles. In determining such ratemaking principles, the
  7 30 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified

  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.
  8 15    The bill provides that notwithstanding any provisions of
  8 16 Code chapter 476 to the contrary, the ratemaking principles

  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a

  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the

  7 35    The bill provides that in determining the applicable
  8  1 ratemaking principles, the board shall find that the proposed

  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.

  5 29    This bill relates to the sale or acquisition of certain
  5 30 utilities.
  5 31    The bill establishes a procedure for the disposal of city
  5 32 utilities by sale. The bill provides that a proposal to
  5 33 discontinue a city utility and dispose of such utility by sale
  5 34 shall not be submitted to the voters of the city pursuant to
  5 35 Code section 388.2 unless the governing body of the city meets
  6  1 the requirements of the bill.
  6  2    The bill requires the governing body of the city utility
  6  3 to determine the fair market value of the utility system, as
  6  4 specified in the bill. The governing body's determination of
  6  5 the city utility's fair market value shall not be dispositive
  6  6 of the city utility's system price, which shall be subject to
  6  7 negotiation by the governing body.
  6  8    The bill provides that the governing body shall prepare an
  6  9 inventory of the city utility's real and personal property,
  6 10 and a statement of net position or balance sheet, including
  6 11 all assets, liabilities, and outstanding revenue and general
  6 12 obligations used to finance the city utility system. The
  6 13 bill also requires the governing body to prepare a financial
  6 14 information statement of the city utility, as specified in the
  6 15 bill.
  6 16    The bill requires the governing body to consider
  6 17 alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale,
  6 18 including entering into an agreement pursuant to Code chapter
  6 19 28E, or into a finance agreement, purchase agreement, or lease
  6 20 agreement with certain entities.
  6 21    The bill requires the governing body to make certain
  6 22 information available on its internet site, as specified in
  6 23 the bill. The bill also requires the governing body to make
  6 24 a good=faith effort to provide certain information by regular
  6 25 mail to each property owner of the city and each ratepayer of
  6 26 the city utility, as specified in the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a
  6 29 proposal to discontinue and dispose of a city utility pursuant
  6 30 to Code section 388.2. If such a proposal is to be submitted
  6 31 to voters, the council shall submit the proposal at the next
  6 32 general election, regular city election, or a special election
  6 33 called for that purpose, within 120 days after the governing
  6 34 body meets the requirements of the bill. Any such proposal
  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.
  7  2 No action may be brought which questions the legality of an
  7  3 election or the city and governing body's compliance with the
  7  4 bill, except as provided in Code section 57.1, within 20 days
  7  5 of the canvass of votes by the county board of supervisors.
  7  6    The bill also establishes a procedure for the acquisition
  7  7 of water, sanitary sewer, and storm water utilities by
  7  8 rate=regulated public utilities, as defined in the bill.
  7  9    The bill provides that a public utility shall not acquire,
  7 10 in whole or in part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water
  7 11 utility with a fair market value of $500,000 or more from
  7 12 certain non=rate=regulated entities, unless the Iowa utilities
  7 13 board first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be
  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the
  7 15 requirements for the disposal of city utilities by sale, as
  7 16 specified in the bill, before such acquisition.
  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the
  7 18 board, prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water,
  7 19 sanitary sewer, or storm water utility, for advance approval of
  7 20 a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers
  7 21 of the acquired utility.
  7 22    The bill provides that as part of its review of the proposed
  7 23 acquisition, the board shall specify in advance, by order
  7 24 issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking
  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility
  7 28 shall be used in determining the applicable ratemaking
  7 29 principles. In determining such ratemaking principles, the
  7 30 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified
  7 34 regulated rates for a period of time.
  7 35    The bill provides that in determining the applicable
  8  1 ratemaking principles, the board shall find that the proposed
  8  2 acquisition will result in just and reasonable rates to all
  8  3 customers, including but not limited to existing customers.
  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.
  8 15    The bill provides that notwithstanding any provisions of
  8 16 Code chapter 476 to the contrary, the ratemaking principles
  8 17 established by the board pursuant to the bill shall be binding
  8 18 with regard to the acquired utility in any subsequent rate
  8 19 proceeding.

  4 13 In addition, if the utility to be acquired is a city utility,
  4 14 then the public utility shall not acquire the city utility
  4 15 until the city has first met the requirements of section
  4 16 388.2A.
  4 17    b.  If a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water utility that
  4 18 is the subject of an acquisition meets the requirements of
  4 19 paragraph "a", then the acquiring public utility may apply to
  4 20 the board, prior to the completion of the acquisition, for
  4 21 advance approval of a proposed initial tariff for providing
  4 22 service to customers of the acquired utility.
  4 23    c.  As part of its review of the proposed acquisition,
  4 24 the board shall specify in advance, by order issued after a
  4 25 contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles that will
  4 26 apply when the costs of the acquired utility are included in
  4 27 regulated rates. The lesser of the sale price or the fair
  4 28 market value of the acquired utility as established pursuant
  4 29 to section 388.2A, subsection 2, shall be used in determining
  4 30 the applicable ratemaking principles. In determining the
  4 31 applicable ratemaking principles, the board shall not be
  4 32 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or traditional
  4 33 cost recovery mechanisms. Among the principles and mechanisms
  4 34 the board may consider, the board has the authority to approve
  4 35 ratemaking principles that provide for reasonable restrictions
  5  1 upon the ability of the public utility to seek an increase
  5  2 in specified regulated rates for a period of time after the
  5  3 acquisition takes place.
  5  4    d.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles,
  5  5 the board shall find that the proposed acquisition will result
  5  6 in just and reasonable rates to all customers of the public
  5  7 utility, including but not limited to existing customers of the
  5  8 public utility. In making this finding, the board may consider
  5  9 any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates,
  5 10 including but not limited to the price paid for the acquired
  5 11 utility and the projected cost of reasonable and prudent
  5 12 changes to the acquired utility in order to provide adequate
  5 13 services and facilities to customers. The board shall consider
  5 14 whether there are ratemaking principles that will result in
  5 15 just and reasonable rates to all customers in determining
  5 16 whether to approve or disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  5 17    e.  Upon the approval of a proposal for acquisition by
  5 18 board order, the parties subject to the acquisition shall
  5 19 have the option of either proceeding with such acquisition or
  5 20 not, subject to any termination provisions contained in the
  5 21 acquisition agreement.
  5 22    f.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
  5 23 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the board
  5 24 pursuant to this section shall be binding with regard to the
  5 25 acquired utility in any subsequent rate proceeding.

  5 30 utilities.
  5 31    The bill establishes a procedure for the disposal of city
  5 32 utilities by sale. The bill provides that a proposal to
  5 33 discontinue a city utility and dispose of such utility by sale
  5 34 shall not be submitted to the voters of the city pursuant to
  5 35 Code section 388.2 unless the governing body of the city meets
  6  1 the requirements of the bill.
  6  2    The bill requires the governing body of the city utility
  6  3 to determine the fair market value of the utility system, as
  6  4 specified in the bill. The governing body's determination of
  6  5 the city utility's fair market value shall not be dispositive
  6  6 of the city utility's system price, which shall be subject to
  6  7 negotiation by the governing body.
  6  8    The bill provides that the governing body shall prepare an
  6  9 inventory of the city utility's real and personal property,
  6 10 and a statement of net position or balance sheet, including
  6 11 all assets, liabilities, and outstanding revenue and general
  6 12 obligations used to finance the city utility system. The
  6 13 bill also requires the governing body to prepare a financial
  6 14 information statement of the city utility, as specified in the
  6 15 bill.
  6 16    The bill requires the governing body to consider
  6 17 alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale,
  6 18 including entering into an agreement pursuant to Code chapter
  6 19 28E, or into a finance agreement, purchase agreement, or lease
  6 20 agreement with certain entities.
  6 21    The bill requires the governing body to make certain
  6 22 information available on its internet site, as specified in
  6 23 the bill. The bill also requires the governing body to make
  6 24 a good=faith effort to provide certain information by regular
  6 25 mail to each property owner of the city and each ratepayer of
  6 26 the city utility, as specified in the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a
  6 29 proposal to discontinue and dispose of a city utility pursuant
  6 30 to Code section 388.2. If such a proposal is to be submitted
  6 31 to voters, the council shall submit the proposal at the next
  6 32 general election, regular city election, or a special election
  6 33 called for that purpose, within 120 days after the governing
  6 34 body meets the requirements of the bill. Any such proposal
  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.
  7  2 No action may be brought which questions the legality of an
  7  3 election or the city and governing body's compliance with the
  7  4 bill, except as provided in Code section 57.1, within 20 days
  7  5 of the canvass of votes by the county board of supervisors.
  7  6    The bill also establishes a procedure for the acquisition
  7  7 of water, sanitary sewer, and storm water utilities by
  7  8 rate=regulated public utilities, as defined in the bill.
  7  9    The bill provides that a public utility shall not acquire,
  7 10 in whole or in part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water
  7 11 utility with a fair market value of $500,000 or more from
  7 12 certain non=rate=regulated entities, unless the Iowa utilities
  7 13 board first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be
  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the
  7 15 requirements for the disposal of city utilities by sale, as
  7 16 specified in the bill, before such acquisition.
  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the
  7 18 board, prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water,
  7 19 sanitary sewer, or storm water utility, for advance approval of
  7 20 a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers
  7 21 of the acquired utility.
  7 22    The bill provides that as part of its review of the proposed
  7 23 acquisition, the board shall specify in advance, by order
  7 24 issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking
  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility
  7 28 shall be used in determining the applicable ratemaking
  7 29 principles. In determining such ratemaking principles, the
  7 30 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified
  7 34 regulated rates for a period of time.
  7 35    The bill provides that in determining the applicable
  8  1 ratemaking principles, the board shall find that the proposed
  8  2 acquisition will result in just and reasonable rates to all
  8  3 customers, including but not limited to existing customers.
  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.
  8 15    The bill provides that notwithstanding any provisions of
  8 16 Code chapter 476 to the contrary, the ratemaking principles
  8 17 established by the board pursuant to the bill shall be binding
  8 18 with regard to the acquired utility in any subsequent rate
  8 19 proceeding.

  4 20 the board, prior to the completion of the acquisition, for
  4 21 advance approval of a proposed initial tariff for providing
  4 22 service to customers of the acquired utility.
  4 23    c.  As part of its review of the proposed acquisition,

  4 26 apply when the costs of the acquired utility are included in
  4 27 regulated rates. The lesser of the sale price or the fair
  4 28 market value of the acquired utility as established pursuant
  4 29 to section 388.2A, subsection 2, shall be used in determining
  4 30 the applicable ratemaking principles. In determining the
  4 31 applicable ratemaking principles, the board shall not be
  4 32 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or traditional
  4 33 cost recovery mechanisms. Among the principles and mechanisms

  4 35 ratemaking principles that provide for reasonable restrictions
  5  1 upon the ability of the public utility to seek an increase
  5  2 in specified regulated rates for a period of time after the
  5  3 acquisition takes place.
  5  4    d.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles,
  5  5 the board shall find that the proposed acquisition will result
  5  6 in just and reasonable rates to all customers of the public

  5  9 any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates,
  5 10 including but not limited to the price paid for the acquired
  5 11 utility and the projected cost of reasonable and prudent
  5 12 changes to the acquired utility in order to provide adequate
  5 13 services and facilities to customers. The board shall consider

  6  1 the requirements of the bill.
  6  2    The bill requires the governing body of the city utility
  6  3 to determine the fair market value of the utility system, as
  6  4 specified in the bill. The governing body's determination of

  6  6 of the city utility's system price, which shall be subject to
  6  7 negotiation by the governing body.
  6  8    The bill provides that the governing body shall prepare an
  6  9 inventory of the city utility's real and personal property,
  6 10 and a statement of net position or balance sheet, including
  6 11 all assets, liabilities, and outstanding revenue and general
  6 12 obligations used to finance the city utility system. The
  6 13 bill also requires the governing body to prepare a financial
  6 14 information statement of the city utility, as specified in the
  6 15 bill.
  6 16    The bill requires the governing body to consider
  6 17 alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale,
  6 18 including entering into an agreement pursuant to Code chapter

  6 20 agreement with certain entities.
  6 21    The bill requires the governing body to make certain
  6 22 information available on its internet site, as specified in

  6 25 mail to each property owner of the city and each ratepayer of
  6 26 the city utility, as specified in the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a
  6 29 proposal to discontinue and dispose of a city utility pursuant
  6 30 to Code section 388.2. If such a proposal is to be submitted
  6 31 to voters, the council shall submit the proposal at the next
  6 32 general election, regular city election, or a special election
  6 33 called for that purpose, within 120 days after the governing
  6 34 body meets the requirements of the bill. Any such proposal
  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.
  7  2 No action may be brought which questions the legality of an
  7  3 election or the city and governing body's compliance with the
  7  4 bill, except as provided in Code section 57.1, within 20 days
  7  5 of the canvass of votes by the county board of supervisors.
  7  6    The bill also establishes a procedure for the acquisition

  7 10 in whole or in part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water
  7 11 utility with a fair market value of $500,000 or more from
  7 12 certain non=rate=regulated entities, unless the Iowa utilities
  7 13 board first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be
  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the
  7 15 requirements for the disposal of city utilities by sale, as
  7 16 specified in the bill, before such acquisition.
  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the
  7 18 board, prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water,
  7 19 sanitary sewer, or storm water utility, for advance approval of
  7 20 a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers
  7 21 of the acquired utility.
  7 22    The bill provides that as part of its review of the proposed
  7 23 acquisition, the board shall specify in advance, by order
  7 24 issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking
  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility
  7 28 shall be used in determining the applicable ratemaking
  7 29 principles. In determining such ratemaking principles, the
  7 30 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified
  7 34 regulated rates for a period of time.
  7 35    The bill provides that in determining the applicable
  8  1 ratemaking principles, the board shall find that the proposed
  8  2 acquisition will result in just and reasonable rates to all
  8  3 customers, including but not limited to existing customers.
  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.
  8 15    The bill provides that notwithstanding any provisions of

  8 17 established by the board pursuant to the bill shall be binding
  8 18 with regard to the acquired utility in any subsequent rate

  5 30 utilities.
  5 31    The bill establishes a procedure for the disposal of city
  5 32 utilities by sale. The bill provides that a proposal to
  5 33 discontinue a city utility and dispose of such utility by sale
  5 34 shall not be submitted to the voters of the city pursuant to
  5 35 Code section 388.2 unless the governing body of the city meets
  6  1 the requirements of the bill.
  6  2    The bill requires the governing body of the city utility
  6  3 to determine the fair market value of the utility system, as
  6  4 specified in the bill. The governing body's determination of
  6  5 the city utility's fair market value shall not be dispositive
  6  6 of the city utility's system price, which shall be subject to
  6  7 negotiation by the governing body.
  6  8    The bill provides that the governing body shall prepare an
  6  9 inventory of the city utility's real and personal property,
  6 10 and a statement of net position or balance sheet, including
  6 11 all assets, liabilities, and outstanding revenue and general
  6 12 obligations used to finance the city utility system. The
  6 13 bill also requires the governing body to prepare a financial
  6 14 information statement of the city utility, as specified in the
  6 15 bill.
  6 16    The bill requires the governing body to consider
  6 17 alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale,
  6 18 including entering into an agreement pursuant to Code chapter
  6 19 28E, or into a finance agreement, purchase agreement, or lease
  6 20 agreement with certain entities.
  6 21    The bill requires the governing body to make certain
  6 22 information available on its internet site, as specified in
  6 23 the bill. The bill also requires the governing body to make
  6 24 a good=faith effort to provide certain information by regular
  6 25 mail to each property owner of the city and each ratepayer of
  6 26 the city utility, as specified in the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a
  6 29 proposal to discontinue and dispose of a city utility pursuant
  6 30 to Code section 388.2. If such a proposal is to be submitted
  6 31 to voters, the council shall submit the proposal at the next
  6 32 general election, regular city election, or a special election
  6 33 called for that purpose, within 120 days after the governing
  6 34 body meets the requirements of the bill. Any such proposal
  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.
  7  2 No action may be brought which questions the legality of an
  7  3 election or the city and governing body's compliance with the
  7  4 bill, except as provided in Code section 57.1, within 20 days
  7  5 of the canvass of votes by the county board of supervisors.
  7  6    The bill also establishes a procedure for the acquisition
  7  7 of water, sanitary sewer, and storm water utilities by
  7  8 rate=regulated public utilities, as defined in the bill.
  7  9    The bill provides that a public utility shall not acquire,
  7 10 in whole or in part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water
  7 11 utility with a fair market value of $500,000 or more from
  7 12 certain non=rate=regulated entities, unless the Iowa utilities
  7 13 board first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be
  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the
  7 15 requirements for the disposal of city utilities by sale, as
  7 16 specified in the bill, before such acquisition.
  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the
  7 18 board, prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water,
  7 19 sanitary sewer, or storm water utility, for advance approval of
  7 20 a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers
  7 21 of the acquired utility.
  7 22    The bill provides that as part of its review of the proposed
  7 23 acquisition, the board shall specify in advance, by order
  7 24 issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking
  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility
  7 28 shall be used in determining the applicable ratemaking
  7 29 principles. In determining such ratemaking principles, the
  7 30 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified
  7 34 regulated rates for a period of time.
  7 35    The bill provides that in determining the applicable
  8  1 ratemaking principles, the board shall find that the proposed
  8  2 acquisition will result in just and reasonable rates to all
  8  3 customers, including but not limited to existing customers.
  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.
  8 15    The bill provides that notwithstanding any provisions of
  8 16 Code chapter 476 to the contrary, the ratemaking principles
  8 17 established by the board pursuant to the bill shall be binding
  8 18 with regard to the acquired utility in any subsequent rate
  8 19 proceeding.

  4 34 the board may consider, the board has the authority to approve
  4 35 ratemaking principles that provide for reasonable restrictions
  5  1 upon the ability of the public utility to seek an increase
  5  2 in specified regulated rates for a period of time after the
  5  3 acquisition takes place.

  5  6 in just and reasonable rates to all customers of the public
  5  7 utility, including but not limited to existing customers of the
  5  8 public utility. In making this finding, the board may consider
  5  9 any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates,
  5 10 including but not limited to the price paid for the acquired
  5 11 utility and the projected cost of reasonable and prudent
  5 12 changes to the acquired utility in order to provide adequate
  5 13 services and facilities to customers. The board shall consider
  5 14 whether there are ratemaking principles that will result in
  5 15 just and reasonable rates to all customers in determining

  6  2    The bill requires the governing body of the city utility
  6  3 to determine the fair market value of the utility system, as
  6  4 specified in the bill. The governing body's determination of

  6  6 of the city utility's system price, which shall be subject to
  6  7 negotiation by the governing body.
  6  8    The bill provides that the governing body shall prepare an
  6  9 inventory of the city utility's real and personal property,
  6 10 and a statement of net position or balance sheet, including
  6 11 all assets, liabilities, and outstanding revenue and general
  6 12 obligations used to finance the city utility system. The
  6 13 bill also requires the governing body to prepare a financial
  6 14 information statement of the city utility, as specified in the
  6 15 bill.
  6 16    The bill requires the governing body to consider
  6 17 alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale,
  6 18 including entering into an agreement pursuant to Code chapter
  6 19 28E, or into a finance agreement, purchase agreement, or lease
  6 20 agreement with certain entities.
  6 21    The bill requires the governing body to make certain
  6 22 information available on its internet site, as specified in
  6 23 the bill. The bill also requires the governing body to make
  6 24 a good=faith effort to provide certain information by regular
  6 25 mail to each property owner of the city and each ratepayer of
  6 26 the city utility, as specified in the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a
  6 29 proposal to discontinue and dispose of a city utility pursuant
  6 30 to Code section 388.2. If such a proposal is to be submitted
  6 31 to voters, the council shall submit the proposal at the next
  6 32 general election, regular city election, or a special election
  6 33 called for that purpose, within 120 days after the governing
  6 34 body meets the requirements of the bill. Any such proposal
  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.
  7  2 No action may be brought which questions the legality of an
  7  3 election or the city and governing body's compliance with the
  7  4 bill, except as provided in Code section 57.1, within 20 days
  7  5 of the canvass of votes by the county board of supervisors.
  7  6    The bill also establishes a procedure for the acquisition

  7 10 in whole or in part, a water, sanitary sewer, or storm water
  7 11 utility with a fair market value of $500,000 or more from
  7 12 certain non=rate=regulated entities, unless the Iowa utilities
  7 13 board first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be
  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the
  7 15 requirements for the disposal of city utilities by sale, as
  7 16 specified in the bill, before such acquisition.
  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the
  7 18 board, prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water,
  7 19 sanitary sewer, or storm water utility, for advance approval of
  7 20 a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers
  7 21 of the acquired utility.
  7 22    The bill provides that as part of its review of the proposed
  7 23 acquisition, the board shall specify in advance, by order
  7 24 issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking
  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility
  7 28 shall be used in determining the applicable ratemaking
  7 29 principles. In determining such ratemaking principles, the
  7 30 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified
  7 34 regulated rates for a period of time.
  7 35    The bill provides that in determining the applicable
  8  1 ratemaking principles, the board shall find that the proposed
  8  2 acquisition will result in just and reasonable rates to all
  8  3 customers, including but not limited to existing customers.
  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.
  8 15    The bill provides that notwithstanding any provisions of
  8 16 Code chapter 476 to the contrary, the ratemaking principles
  8 17 established by the board pursuant to the bill shall be binding
  8 18 with regard to the acquired utility in any subsequent rate
  8 19 proceeding.

  4 27 regulated rates. The lesser of the sale price or the fair
  4 28 market value of the acquired utility as established pursuant
  4 29 to section 388.2A, subsection 2, shall be used in determining
  4 30 the applicable ratemaking principles. In determining the
  4 31 applicable ratemaking principles, the board shall not be
  4 32 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or traditional
  4 33 cost recovery mechanisms. Among the principles and mechanisms

  5  1 upon the ability of the public utility to seek an increase
  5  2 in specified regulated rates for a period of time after the

  5  6 in just and reasonable rates to all customers of the public
  5  7 utility, including but not limited to existing customers of the
  5  8 public utility. In making this finding, the board may consider
  5  9 any factor it reasonably concludes may affect future rates,
  5 10 including but not limited to the price paid for the acquired
  5 11 utility and the projected cost of reasonable and prudent
  5 12 changes to the acquired utility in order to provide adequate
  5 13 services and facilities to customers. The board shall consider
  5 14 whether there are ratemaking principles that will result in
  5 15 just and reasonable rates to all customers in determining
  5 16 whether to approve or disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  5 17    e.  Upon the approval of a proposal for acquisition by
  5 18 board order, the parties subject to the acquisition shall
  5 19 have the option of either proceeding with such acquisition or
  5 20 not, subject to any termination provisions contained in the
  5 21 acquisition agreement.
  5 22    f.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
  5 23 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the board
  5 24 pursuant to this section shall be binding with regard to the

  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified
  7 34 regulated rates for a period of time.
  7 35    The bill provides that in determining the applicable
  8  1 ratemaking principles, the board shall find that the proposed
  8  2 acquisition will result in just and reasonable rates to all
  8  3 customers, including but not limited to existing customers.
  8  4 In making this finding, the board may consider any factor it
  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with

  6  2    The bill requires the governing body of the city utility
  6  3 to determine the fair market value of the utility system, as
  6  4 specified in the bill. The governing body's determination of

  6  6 of the city utility's system price, which shall be subject to
  6  7 negotiation by the governing body.
  6  8    The bill provides that the governing body shall prepare an
  6  9 inventory of the city utility's real and personal property,
  6 10 and a statement of net position or balance sheet, including
  6 11 all assets, liabilities, and outstanding revenue and general
  6 12 obligations used to finance the city utility system. The
  6 13 bill also requires the governing body to prepare a financial
  6 14 information statement of the city utility, as specified in the
  6 15 bill.
  6 16    The bill requires the governing body to consider
  6 17 alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale,
  6 18 including entering into an agreement pursuant to Code chapter

  6 26 the city utility, as specified in the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a

  6 32 general election, regular city election, or a special election
  6 33 called for that purpose, within 120 days after the governing

  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.
  7  2 No action may be brought which questions the legality of an
  7  3 election or the city and governing body's compliance with the

  7 13 board first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be
  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the

  7 16 specified in the bill, before such acquisition.
  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the
  7 18 board, prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water,

  7 23 acquisition, the board shall specify in advance, by order
  7 24 issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking
  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility
  7 28 shall be used in determining the applicable ratemaking
  7 29 principles. In determining such ratemaking principles, the
  7 30 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
  7 33 ability of the public utility to seek an increase in specified
  7 34 regulated rates for a period of time.

  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the

  8  5 reasonable includes may affect future rates, as specified
  8  6 in the bill. The board shall consider whether there are
  8  7 ratemaking principles that will result in just and reasonable
  8  8 rates to all customers in determining whether to approve or
  8  9 disapprove a proposed acquisition.
  8 10    The bill provides that upon the approval of a proposal
  8 11 for acquisition by board order, the parties subject to the
  8 12 acquisition shall have the option of either proceeding with
  8 13 the acquisition or not, subject to any applicable termination
  8 14 provisions contained in the acquisition agreement.
  8 15    The bill provides that notwithstanding any provisions of

  6  7 negotiation by the governing body.
  6  8    The bill provides that the governing body shall prepare an
  6  9 inventory of the city utility's real and personal property,
  6 10 and a statement of net position or balance sheet, including
  6 11 all assets, liabilities, and outstanding revenue and general

  6 16    The bill requires the governing body to consider
  6 17 alternatives to disposing of the city utility by sale,
  6 18 including entering into an agreement pursuant to Code chapter

  6 23 the bill. The bill also requires the governing body to make
  6 24 a good=faith effort to provide certain information by regular
  6 25 mail to each property owner of the city and each ratepayer of
  6 26 the city utility, as specified in the bill.
  6 27    The bill provides that upon a governing body meeting the
  6 28 requirements specified in the bill, a city council may submit a

  6 35 approved by the voters shall not require the governing body or
  7  1 any purchasing entity to finalize a sale of the city utility.
  7  2 No action may be brought which questions the legality of an
  7  3 election or the city and governing body's compliance with the

  7 13 board first approves the acquisition. If the utility to be
  7 14 required is a city utility, then the city must first meet the

  7 17    The bill allows an acquiring public utility to apply to the
  7 18 board, prior to the completion of an acquisition of a water,

  7 20 a proposed initial tariff for providing service to customers
  7 21 of the acquired utility.
  7 22    The bill provides that as part of its review of the proposed
  7 23 acquisition, the board shall specify in advance, by order
  7 24 issued after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking
  7 25 principles that will apply when the costs of the acquired
  7 26 utility are included in regulated rates. The lesser of the
  7 27 sale price or the fair market value of the acquired utility

  7 31 or cost recovery mechanisms, and may approve ratemaking
  7 32 principles that provide for reasonable restrictions upon the
