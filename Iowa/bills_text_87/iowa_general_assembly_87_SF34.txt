  6  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  8    This bill relates to the exclusion of retirement income from
  6  9 the computation of net income for purposes of the individual
  6 10 income tax.
  6 11    Under current law, a taxpayer may exclude all retirement
  6 12 pay, including certain survivor benefits, received from the
  6 13 federal government for military service performed in the armed
  6 14 forces, the armed forces military reserve, or national guard.
  6 15    In addition, a taxpayer who is disabled, who is at least 55
  6 16 years of age, or who is the surviving spouse or other specified
  6 17 survivor of that qualifying taxpayer, may exclude a maximum
  6 18 of $6,000 of other retirement income ($12,000 for married
  6 19 couples).
  6 20    The bill phases in over a five=year period the complete
  6 21 exclusion from the individual income tax of a taxpayer's
  6 22 retirement income remaining after the two exclusions referenced
  6 23 above. The percentage of this retirement income that is
  6 24 excluded for tax years beginning in 2017, 2018, 2019, and
  6 25 2020, is 20 percent, 40 percent, 60 percent, and 80 percent,
  6 26 respectively.  For tax years beginning in 2021 or later, 100
  6 27 percent of a taxpayer's retirement income will be excluded from
  6 28 the individual income tax.
  6 29    The bill also excludes this retirement income from the
  6 30 calculation of net income for purposes of determining whether
  6 31 or not a taxpayer's net income exceeds the amount at which the
  6 32 individual income tax will not be imposed pursuant to Code
  6 33 section 422.5(3) or Code section 422.5(3B), and for which an
  6 34 individual income tax return is not required to be filed, and
  6 35 for purposes of calculating the alternate tax in Code section
  7  1 422.5, and further provides that any retirement income excluded
  7  2 from the individual income tax will not be added back to these
  7  3 calculations for tax years beginning in 2021 or later.
  7  4    The bill defines "retirement income" for purposes of the
  7  5 exclusion.
  7  6    The bill applies retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax
  7  7 years beginning on or after that date.
