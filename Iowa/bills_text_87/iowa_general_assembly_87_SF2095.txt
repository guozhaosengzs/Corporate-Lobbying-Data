 10 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 13    This bill relates to employment of unauthorized aliens and
 10 14 human trafficking and related offenses and provides penalties.
 10 15    New Code section 73A.22 is created to prohibit state
 10 16 entities from awarding a contract or providing developmental
 10 17 assistance to a person who violates the provisions of the bill
 10 18 concerning the employment of unauthorized aliens as established
 10 19 in new Code section 91F.2.  The bill defines "developmental
 10 20 assistance" as any form of public assistance, including tax
 10 21 incentives, grants, or other subsidies.  The bill provides that
 10 22 a person violating this new provision shall have their contract
 10 23 or developmental assistance terminated. The bill grants state
 10 24 entities the right to enforce their rights in district court
 10 25 and provides that a person violating this provision shall be
 10 26 prohibited from receiving a state contract or developmental
 10 27 assistance for five years.
 10 28    The bill creates new Code chapter 91F prohibiting employers
 10 29 from employing unauthorized aliens.  The bill defines
 10 30 "unauthorized alien" as any person who is not a citizen or
 10 31 legal resident and who has not been lawfully admitted to the
 10 32 United States for permanent residence or who is not authorized
 10 33 to work in the United States.  An "employer" is any person who
 10 34 employs for wages, paid on an hourly basis, one or more natural
 10 35 persons.  The bill prohibits employers from knowingly employing
 11  1 an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that a violation can
 11  2 occur in cases in which an employer actually knows a person
 11  3 is an unauthorized alien as well as a situation in which any
 11  4 person exercising reasonable care should know from facts and
 11  5 circumstances that a person is an unauthorized alien. The
 11  6 bill provides that a violation of this Code chapter is subject
 11  7 to a civil penalty of $1,000 and a corporate officer of an
 11  8 employer who, through repeated violations of the Code chapter,
 11  9 demonstrates a pattern of employing unauthorized  aliens,
 11 10 commits a serious misdemeanor.  An employer who demonstrates
 11 11 a pattern of employing unauthorized aliens may be ordered to
 11 12 pay punitive damages.  The bill further authorizes the labor
 11 13 commissioner within the department of workforce development to
 11 14 adopt rules to administer and enforce this new Code chapter and
 11 15 grants the commissioner the authority to investigate employer
 11 16 records and to interview employees.  The bill provides that the
 11 17 commissioner shall forward any  suspected violations of this
 11 18 Code chapter to the attorney general for prosecution. The
 11 19 bill further provides that an employer shall not discharge
 11 20 an employee from or take or fail to take action regarding an
 11 21 employee's appointment or proposed appointment, promotion or
 11 22 proposed promotion, or regarding any advantage of an employee
 11 23 as a reprisal for a failure by that employee to inform the
 11 24 employer that the employee made a disclosure of information to
 11 25 any law enforcement agency if the  employee reasonably believes
 11 26 the information evidences a violation of Code section 91F.2,
 11 27 710A.2, 710A.2A, 710A.2B, 710A.2C, or 710A.2D.  An employer
 11 28 who violates the provisions of this Code chapter is liable
 11 29 to an aggrieved employee for affirmative relief including
 11 30 reinstatement, with or without back pay, or any other equitable
 11 31 relief the court deems appropriate, including attorney fees and
 11 32 costs.  In addition, an action for injunctive relief may be
 11 33 brought by an aggrieved employee or the attorney general.
 11 34    The bill provides that a person who knowingly subjects,
 11 35 attempts to subject, or engages in a conspiracy to subject
 12  1 another person to forced labor or services by causing or
 12  2 threatening to cause serious physical injury to that person, by
 12  3 physically restraining or threatening to physically restrain
 12  4 another person, by abusing or threatening to abuse the law
 12  5 or legal process, or by destroying, concealing,  removing,
 12  6 confiscating, or possessing any actual or purported passport or
 12  7 other immigration document, or any other actual or purported
 12  8 government identification document, of another person is guilty
 12  9 of the crime of forced labor and services and is subject to a
 12 10 class "B" felony, a class "C" felony, or a class "D" felony,
 12 11 depending upon the circumstances of the offense.  A class "B"
 12 12 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than 25 years,
 12 13 a class "C" felony is punishable by  confinement for no more
 12 14 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 12 15 $10,000, and a class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 12 16 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 12 17 more than $7,500.  The bill provides sentencing enhancements
 12 18 for a crime involving a minor victim, depending on the
 12 19 circumstances of the offense, ranging from a class "A" felony,
 12 20 punishable by confinement for life without the possibility of
 12 21 parole, to a class "C" felony.
 12 22    The bill provides that a person who knowingly recruits,
 12 23 entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any
 12 24 means, or attempts to recruit, entice, harbor, transport,
 12 25 provide, or obtain by any means, another person, with the
 12 26 intent that the person be subjected to forced labor or
 12 27 services, or a person who knowingly benefits, financially or by
 12 28 receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture
 12 29 that involves forced labor or services, is guilty of a class
 12 30 "B" felony, except if the person being trafficked is a minor, a
 12 31 person who commits either act is guilty of a class "A" felony.
 12 32    The bill further provides that a person who knowingly
 12 33 recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by
 12 34 any means, or attempts to recruit, entice, harbor, transport,
 12 35 provide, or obtain by any means, a minor, with the intent that
 13  1 the minor be subjected to sexual exploitation in violation of
 13  2 Code section 728.12, Iowa's sexual exploitation of a minor
 13  3 statute, or a person who knowingly benefits, financially or by
 13  4 receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture
 13  5 that involves a violation of Code section 728.12, is guilty of
 13  6 a class "A" felony.
 13  7    The bill provides sentencing enhancements for the crimes
 13  8 of forced labor and services and human trafficking in forced
 13  9 labor and services.  The bill provides that if the commission
 13 10 of any such offense results in the death of the person or if
 13 11 the person is kidnapped, the defendant is guilty of a class "A"
 13 12 felony.
 13 13    The bill provides that if a corporation is convicted of
 13 14 the  crimes of forced labor and services, human trafficking
 13 15 in forced labor and services, or human trafficking in the
 13 16 sexual exploitation of a minor, the court shall order the
 13 17 corporation's dissolution or reorganization; order the
 13 18 suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or prior
 13 19 approval granted by a state agency in Iowa; or order the
 13 20 surrender of the corporation's charter if organized under state
 13 21 law or revocation of the foreign corporation's certificate to
 13 22 conduct business in the state.
 13 23    The bill provides that a victim under the bill shall receive
 13 24 restitution pursuant to Code chapter 910 for damages resulting
 13 25 directly from a violation, and the restitution shall include
 13 26 a fine of the greater of either the gross income or value of
 13 27 the victim's labor or services, or the value of the victim's
 13 28 wages of not less than the current minimum wage under the
 13 29 federal Fair Labor Standards Act or under the Iowa minimum wage
 13 30 pursuant to Code section 91D.1.
 13 31    The bill provides that in addition to other victim rights
 13 32 provided in Code chapter 915, including the right to receive
 13 33 victim compensation pursuant to Code section 915.84 and the
 13 34 right to exert victim counseling privileges pursuant to Code
 13 35 section 915.20A, victims shall have the right to receive  prompt
 14  1 medical care including mental health care, food, shelter, and

 14  5 identifying information of victims and their family members are
 14  6 not disclosed to the public if a victim's safety is at risk or
 14  7 if there is any danger of additional harm, without regard to
 14  8 their immigration status.
 14  9    The bill authorizes the attorney general to appoint a
 14 10 special assistant attorney general who shall, under the

 10 15    New Code section 73A.22 is created to prohibit state
 10 16 entities from awarding a contract or providing developmental
 10 17 assistance to a person who violates the provisions of the bill
 10 18 concerning the employment of unauthorized aliens as established
 10 19 in new Code section 91F.2.  The bill defines "developmental
 10 20 assistance" as any form of public assistance, including tax
 10 21 incentives, grants, or other subsidies.  The bill provides that
 10 22 a person violating this new provision shall have their contract
 10 23 or developmental assistance terminated. The bill grants state
 10 24 entities the right to enforce their rights in district court
 10 25 and provides that a person violating this provision shall be
 10 26 prohibited from receiving a state contract or developmental
 10 27 assistance for five years.
 10 28    The bill creates new Code chapter 91F prohibiting employers
 10 29 from employing unauthorized aliens.  The bill defines
 10 30 "unauthorized alien" as any person who is not a citizen or
 10 31 legal resident and who has not been lawfully admitted to the
 10 32 United States for permanent residence or who is not authorized
 10 33 to work in the United States.  An "employer" is any person who
 10 34 employs for wages, paid on an hourly basis, one or more natural
 10 35 persons.  The bill prohibits employers from knowingly employing
 11  1 an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that a violation can
 11  2 occur in cases in which an employer actually knows a person
 11  3 is an unauthorized alien as well as a situation in which any
 11  4 person exercising reasonable care should know from facts and
 11  5 circumstances that a person is an unauthorized alien. The
 11  6 bill provides that a violation of this Code chapter is subject
 11  7 to a civil penalty of $1,000 and a corporate officer of an
 11  8 employer who, through repeated violations of the Code chapter,
 11  9 demonstrates a pattern of employing unauthorized  aliens,
 11 10 commits a serious misdemeanor.  An employer who demonstrates
 11 11 a pattern of employing unauthorized aliens may be ordered to
 11 12 pay punitive damages.  The bill further authorizes the labor
 11 13 commissioner within the department of workforce development to
 11 14 adopt rules to administer and enforce this new Code chapter and
 11 15 grants the commissioner the authority to investigate employer
 11 16 records and to interview employees.  The bill provides that the
 11 17 commissioner shall forward any  suspected violations of this
 11 18 Code chapter to the attorney general for prosecution. The
 11 19 bill further provides that an employer shall not discharge
 11 20 an employee from or take or fail to take action regarding an
 11 21 employee's appointment or proposed appointment, promotion or
 11 22 proposed promotion, or regarding any advantage of an employee
 11 23 as a reprisal for a failure by that employee to inform the
 11 24 employer that the employee made a disclosure of information to
 11 25 any law enforcement agency if the  employee reasonably believes
 11 26 the information evidences a violation of Code section 91F.2,
 11 27 710A.2, 710A.2A, 710A.2B, 710A.2C, or 710A.2D.  An employer
 11 28 who violates the provisions of this Code chapter is liable
 11 29 to an aggrieved employee for affirmative relief including
 11 30 reinstatement, with or without back pay, or any other equitable
 11 31 relief the court deems appropriate, including attorney fees and
 11 32 costs.  In addition, an action for injunctive relief may be
 11 33 brought by an aggrieved employee or the attorney general.
 11 34    The bill provides that a person who knowingly subjects,
 11 35 attempts to subject, or engages in a conspiracy to subject
 12  1 another person to forced labor or services by causing or
 12  2 threatening to cause serious physical injury to that person, by
 12  3 physically restraining or threatening to physically restrain
 12  4 another person, by abusing or threatening to abuse the law
 12  5 or legal process, or by destroying, concealing,  removing,
 12  6 confiscating, or possessing any actual or purported passport or
 12  7 other immigration document, or any other actual or purported
 12  8 government identification document, of another person is guilty
 12  9 of the crime of forced labor and services and is subject to a
 12 10 class "B" felony, a class "C" felony, or a class "D" felony,
 12 11 depending upon the circumstances of the offense.  A class "B"
 12 12 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than 25 years,
 12 13 a class "C" felony is punishable by  confinement for no more
 12 14 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 12 15 $10,000, and a class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 12 16 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 12 17 more than $7,500.  The bill provides sentencing enhancements
 12 18 for a crime involving a minor victim, depending on the
 12 19 circumstances of the offense, ranging from a class "A" felony,
 12 20 punishable by confinement for life without the possibility of
 12 21 parole, to a class "C" felony.
 12 22    The bill provides that a person who knowingly recruits,
 12 23 entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any
 12 24 means, or attempts to recruit, entice, harbor, transport,
 12 25 provide, or obtain by any means, another person, with the
 12 26 intent that the person be subjected to forced labor or
 12 27 services, or a person who knowingly benefits, financially or by
 12 28 receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture
 12 29 that involves forced labor or services, is guilty of a class
 12 30 "B" felony, except if the person being trafficked is a minor, a
 12 31 person who commits either act is guilty of a class "A" felony.
 12 32    The bill further provides that a person who knowingly
 12 33 recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by
 12 34 any means, or attempts to recruit, entice, harbor, transport,
 12 35 provide, or obtain by any means, a minor, with the intent that
 13  1 the minor be subjected to sexual exploitation in violation of
 13  2 Code section 728.12, Iowa's sexual exploitation of a minor
 13  3 statute, or a person who knowingly benefits, financially or by
 13  4 receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture
 13  5 that involves a violation of Code section 728.12, is guilty of
 13  6 a class "A" felony.
 13  7    The bill provides sentencing enhancements for the crimes
 13  8 of forced labor and services and human trafficking in forced
 13  9 labor and services.  The bill provides that if the commission
 13 10 of any such offense results in the death of the person or if
 13 11 the person is kidnapped, the defendant is guilty of a class "A"
 13 12 felony.
 13 13    The bill provides that if a corporation is convicted of
 13 14 the  crimes of forced labor and services, human trafficking
 13 15 in forced labor and services, or human trafficking in the
 13 16 sexual exploitation of a minor, the court shall order the
 13 17 corporation's dissolution or reorganization; order the

 13 19 approval granted by a state agency in Iowa; or order the
 13 20 surrender of the corporation's charter if organized under state
 13 21 law or revocation of the foreign corporation's certificate to
 13 22 conduct business in the state.
 13 23    The bill provides that a victim under the bill shall receive
 13 24 restitution pursuant to Code chapter 910 for damages resulting
 13 25 directly from a violation, and the restitution shall include
 13 26 a fine of the greater of either the gross income or value of
 13 27 the victim's labor or services, or the value of the victim's
 13 28 wages of not less than the current minimum wage under the
 13 29 federal Fair Labor Standards Act or under the Iowa minimum wage
 13 30 pursuant to Code section 91D.1.
 13 31    The bill provides that in addition to other victim rights
 13 32 provided in Code chapter 915, including the right to receive

 11 24 employer that the employee made a disclosure of information to
 11 25 any law enforcement agency if the  employee reasonably believes
 11 26 the information evidences a violation of Code section 91F.2,
 11 27 710A.2, 710A.2A, 710A.2B, 710A.2C, or 710A.2D.  An employer
 11 28 who violates the provisions of this Code chapter is liable
 11 29 to an aggrieved employee for affirmative relief including
 11 30 reinstatement, with or without back pay, or any other equitable

 12 12 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than 25 years,
 12 13 a class "C" felony is punishable by  confinement for no more
 12 14 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than

 11 24 employer that the employee made a disclosure of information to
 11 25 any law enforcement agency if the  employee reasonably believes
 11 26 the information evidences a violation of Code section 91F.2,
 11 27 710A.2, 710A.2A, 710A.2B, 710A.2C, or 710A.2D.  An employer

 10 28    The bill creates new Code chapter 91F prohibiting employers
 10 29 from employing unauthorized aliens.  The bill defines
 10 30 "unauthorized alien" as any person who is not a citizen or
 10 31 legal resident and who has not been lawfully admitted to the
 10 32 United States for permanent residence or who is not authorized
 10 33 to work in the United States.  An "employer" is any person who
 10 34 employs for wages, paid on an hourly basis, one or more natural
 10 35 persons.  The bill prohibits employers from knowingly employing
 11  1 an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that a violation can
 11  2 occur in cases in which an employer actually knows a person
 11  3 is an unauthorized alien as well as a situation in which any
 11  4 person exercising reasonable care should know from facts and
 11  5 circumstances that a person is an unauthorized alien. The
 11  6 bill provides that a violation of this Code chapter is subject
 11  7 to a civil penalty of $1,000 and a corporate officer of an
 11  8 employer who, through repeated violations of the Code chapter,
 11  9 demonstrates a pattern of employing unauthorized  aliens,
 11 10 commits a serious misdemeanor.  An employer who demonstrates
 11 11 a pattern of employing unauthorized aliens may be ordered to
 11 12 pay punitive damages.  The bill further authorizes the labor
 11 13 commissioner within the department of workforce development to
 11 14 adopt rules to administer and enforce this new Code chapter and
 11 15 grants the commissioner the authority to investigate employer
 11 16 records and to interview employees.  The bill provides that the
 11 17 commissioner shall forward any  suspected violations of this
 11 18 Code chapter to the attorney general for prosecution. The
 11 19 bill further provides that an employer shall not discharge
 11 20 an employee from or take or fail to take action regarding an
 11 21 employee's appointment or proposed appointment, promotion or
 11 22 proposed promotion, or regarding any advantage of an employee
 11 23 as a reprisal for a failure by that employee to inform the
 11 24 employer that the employee made a disclosure of information to
 11 25 any law enforcement agency if the  employee reasonably believes
 11 26 the information evidences a violation of Code section 91F.2,
 11 27 710A.2, 710A.2A, 710A.2B, 710A.2C, or 710A.2D.  An employer
 11 28 who violates the provisions of this Code chapter is liable
 11 29 to an aggrieved employee for affirmative relief including
 11 30 reinstatement, with or without back pay, or any other equitable
 11 31 relief the court deems appropriate, including attorney fees and
 11 32 costs.  In addition, an action for injunctive relief may be
 11 33 brought by an aggrieved employee or the attorney general.
 11 34    The bill provides that a person who knowingly subjects,
 11 35 attempts to subject, or engages in a conspiracy to subject
 12  1 another person to forced labor or services by causing or

 12  3 physically restraining or threatening to physically restrain
 12  4 another person, by abusing or threatening to abuse the law
 12  5 or legal process, or by destroying, concealing,  removing,
 12  6 confiscating, or possessing any actual or purported passport or
 12  7 other immigration document, or any other actual or purported
 12  8 government identification document, of another person is guilty
 12  9 of the crime of forced labor and services and is subject to a
 12 10 class "B" felony, a class "C" felony, or a class "D" felony,
 12 11 depending upon the circumstances of the offense.  A class "B"
 12 12 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than 25 years,
 12 13 a class "C" felony is punishable by  confinement for no more
 12 14 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 12 15 $10,000, and a class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 12 16 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 12 17 more than $7,500.  The bill provides sentencing enhancements
 12 18 for a crime involving a minor victim, depending on the
 12 19 circumstances of the offense, ranging from a class "A" felony,
 12 20 punishable by confinement for life without the possibility of
 12 21 parole, to a class "C" felony.
 12 22    The bill provides that a person who knowingly recruits,

 12 28 receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture
 12 29 that involves forced labor or services, is guilty of a class
 12 30 "B" felony, except if the person being trafficked is a minor, a
 12 31 person who commits either act is guilty of a class "A" felony.
 12 32    The bill further provides that a person who knowingly
 12 33 recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by
 12 34 any means, or attempts to recruit, entice, harbor, transport,
 12 35 provide, or obtain by any means, a minor, with the intent that
 13  1 the minor be subjected to sexual exploitation in violation of
 13  2 Code section 728.12, Iowa's sexual exploitation of a minor
 13  3 statute, or a person who knowingly benefits, financially or by
 13  4 receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture
 13  5 that involves a violation of Code section 728.12, is guilty of
 13  6 a class "A" felony.
 13  7    The bill provides sentencing enhancements for the crimes
 13  8 of forced labor and services and human trafficking in forced
 13  9 labor and services.  The bill provides that if the commission

 13 21 law or revocation of the foreign corporation's certificate to
 13 22 conduct business in the state.
 13 23    The bill provides that a victim under the bill shall receive
 13 24 restitution pursuant to Code chapter 910 for damages resulting
 13 25 directly from a violation, and the restitution shall include
 13 26 a fine of the greater of either the gross income or value of
 13 27 the victim's labor or services, or the value of the victim's
 13 28 wages of not less than the current minimum wage under the
 13 29 federal Fair Labor Standards Act or under the Iowa minimum wage
 13 30 pursuant to Code section 91D.1.
 13 31    The bill provides that in addition to other victim rights
 13 32 provided in Code chapter 915, including the right to receive

 11 13 commissioner within the department of workforce development to
 11 14 adopt rules to administer and enforce this new Code chapter and

 11 20 an employee from or take or fail to take action regarding an
 11 21 employee's appointment or proposed appointment, promotion or
 11 22 proposed promotion, or regarding any advantage of an employee
 11 23 as a reprisal for a failure by that employee to inform the
 11 24 employer that the employee made a disclosure of information to
 11 25 any law enforcement agency if the  employee reasonably believes
 11 26 the information evidences a violation of Code section 91F.2,
 11 27 710A.2, 710A.2A, 710A.2B, 710A.2C, or 710A.2D.  An employer

 11 29 to an aggrieved employee for affirmative relief including
 11 30 reinstatement, with or without back pay, or any other equitable
