the
federal
Protecting
Americans
from
Tax
Hikes
Act
of
2015.
1


For
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2016,
taxpayers
2


are
required
to
compute
their
section
179
increased
expensing
3


allowance
according
to
the
method
prescribed
under
section
179
4


of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
in
effect
on
January
1,
2015,
5


which
provides
a
$25,000
limitation
on
expensing
for
taxable
6


years
beginning
after
2014.
7


Under
current
law,
individual
taxpayers
were
required,
when
8


calculating
alternative
minimum
tax
under
Code
section
422.5(2)
9


and
itemized
deductions
under
Code
section
422.9(2)
for
tax
10


year
2009,
to
recompute
their
federal
adjusted
gross
income
11


to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
Iowa
decoupled
from
the
12


2009
federal
changes
to
the
section
179
increased
expensing
13


allowance.
The
bill
provides
that

must
make
those
14


same
adjustments
to
federal
adjusted
gross
income
for
tax
15


years
beginning
on
after
January
1,
2016,
to
account
for
the
16


fact
that
Iowa
has
decoupled
from
changes
to
the
section
179
17


increased
expensing
allowance
as
described
above.
18


Division
III
takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
19


retroactively
to
January
1,
2016,
for
