  1  6    This bill concerns disability retirement benefits for

  1  8 retirement system (IPERS).
  1  9    Current law provides that any amounts payable to a special
  1 10 service member under any workers' compensation, unemployment
  1 11 compensation, employer=paid disability plan, program, or
  1 12 policy, or disability payments the member receives pursuant to
  1 13 the federal Social Security Act, shall be offset against and
  1 14 payable in lieu of any disability retirement benefits payable
  1 15 under IPERS.  The bill strikes this offset provision and allows
  1 16 a special service member to retain both the member's non=IPERS
