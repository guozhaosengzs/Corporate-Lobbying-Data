of

boards,
and

protests
and
appeals.
1


In
2005,
the
property
assessment
appeal
board
was
2


established.
The
legislation
establishing
the
property
3


assessment
appeal
board
included
a
future
repeal
of
the
board
4


effective
July
1,
2013.
This
future
repeal
provision
was
5


amended
in
2013
to
extend
the
date
of
the
repeal
to
July
1,
6


2018.
In
2015,
the
future
repeal
provision
was
again
extended
7


from
July
1,
2018,
to
July
1,
2021.
8


Division
I
of
the
bill
repeals
the
property
assessment
9


appeal
board’s
future
repeal
provisions,
including
the
2013
and
10


2015
amendments
to
those
provisions.
The
bill
also
strikes
a
11


limitation
in
Code
section
441.37A
regarding
the
assessment
12


years
for
which
the
property
assessment
appeal
board
may
hear
13


appeals.
14


For
appeals
to
the
property
assessment
appeal
board
for
15


assessment
years
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2018,
16


the
bill
provides
that
if
the
board
decides
in
favor
of
the
17


property
owner
or
taxpayer
and
the
assessment
is
reduced,
the
18


assessor
is
responsible
for
a
percentage
of
the
reasonable
19


costs
of
the
appeal
incurred
by
the
owner
or
taxpayer
that
is
20


equal
to
the
percentage
reduction
in
the
assessment.
The
bill
21


also
establishes
similar
provisions
for
the
reasonable
costs
of
22


the
owner
or
taxpayer
related
to
an
appeal
to
district
court
23


for
assessment
years
beginning

Current
Code

specifies
a
burden
of
proof
25


for
taxpayer
protests
or
appeals
of
property
assessments
26


made
by
local
assessors.
The
current
standard
imposes
a
27


burden
of
proof
on
the
complainant
attacking
the
valuation
as
28


excessive,
inadequate,
inequitable,
or
capricious.
Only
after
29


the
complainant,
at
the
protest
or
appeal
proceedings,
offers
30


competent
evidence
by
at
least
two
disinterested
witnesses
31


that
the
market
value
of
the
property
is
less
than
the
market
32


value
determined
by
the
assessor
does
the
burden
of
proof
shift
33


to
the
officials
or
persons
seeking
to
uphold
the
assessor’s

valuation.

Division
II
of
the
bill
provides
that
for
assessment
years
1


beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2018,
when
a
valuation
is
2


protested
or
appealed
by
a
complainant,
the
burden
of
proof
3


shall
be
upon
the
assessor
to
demonstrate
that
such
valuation
4


is
not
excessive,
inadequate,
inequitable,
or
capricious.

Division
III
of
the
bill
increases
the
membership
of
county
6


and
city
conference
boards
by
requiring
the
addition
of
four
7


elected
public
members.
The
four
public
members
are
elected
8


on
a
nonpartisan
basis
by
the
applicable
voters
of
the
county
9


or
city
at
the
general
election
or
regular
city
election,
10


as
applicable.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
seeking
11


election
as
a
public
member
of
a
conference
board
must
only
12


file
an
affidavit
of
candidacy.
Each
public
member
seat
on
13


the
conference
board
may
only
be
held
by
an
individual
who
14


owns
or
holds
an
interest
in
taxable
property
located
in
the
15


appropriate
jurisdiction
that
is
classified
as
residential,
16


agricultural,
commercial,
or
industrial
property.
Each
of
17


the
four
property
classifications
is
assigned
to
one
of
the
18


four
public
member
seats
and
designated
as
such
on
the
ballot.
19


The
bill
provides
that
a
public
member
seat
is
not
limited
by
20


property
classification
if
that
property
classification
is
not
21


present
within
the
jurisdiction.
The
four
public
members
each
22


serve
a
four-year
term
and
may
be
reelected
for
additional
23


four-year
terms.
The
four
public
members
each
constitute
a
24


separate
voting
unit.
A
vacancy
among
the
public
member
seats
25


prior
to
the
expiration
of
a
term
is
filled
by
appointment
by
26


the
remaining
public
members
of
the
conference
board.
Such
an
27


appointment
is
for
the
period
until
the
next
pending
election.
28


By
operation
of
current
Code
section
441.3,
the
addition
29


of
the
four
public
members
to
the
conference
board
results
in
30


an
additional
four
appointments
to
the
examining
board
of
the
31


applicable
assessing
jurisdiction.
32


Division
IV

upon
13


which
a
property
owner
or
aggrieved
taxpayer
may
protest
14


an
assessment
under
Code
section
441.37.
The
bill
strikes
15


the
grounds
in
current
law
that
are
applicable
only
to
16


even-numbered
assessment
years
and
allows
those

any

from
the
representation
duties
of
the

23


and
the

department
in
litigation
involving
24


assessments
when
the
county
attorney
or

department
is
representing
the

26


Under
the
bill,
the
conference
board
may
select

27


to
act
as
county
attorney
or
the

only

the

The
