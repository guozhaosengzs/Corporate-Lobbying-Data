The

by

This
bill
modifies
the
workforce
housing
tax
incentives
10


program.
11


BACKGROUND.
The
workforce
housing
tax
incentive
program
12


(program)
administered
by
the
economic
development
authority
13


(authority)
provides
tax
incentives
in
the
form
of
investment
14


tax
credits
and
sales
and
use
tax
refunds
to
housing
businesses
15


that
complete
certain
housing
projects
in
Iowa.
In
order
16


to
receive
tax
incentives,
a
housing
business
must
apply
to
17


the
authority
and
have
its
housing
project
registered
by
18


the
authority,
and
then
must
enter
into
an
agreement
with
19


the
authority
(tax
incentive
agreement)
for
the
successful
20


completion
of
all
requirements
of
the
program.
If
the
housing
21


project
is
completed
and
properly
examined
by
a
certified
22


public
accountant,
and
all
other
requirements
of
the
tax
23


incentive
agreement
and
the
program
are
satisfied,
the
24


authority
may
issue
a
tax
credit
certificate
and
the
housing
25


business
may
claim
the
tax
incentives
for
which
it
qualifies
26


under
the
program.
The
total
tax
incentives
issued
under
27


the
program
per
fiscal
year
cannot
exceed
$20
million.
Of
28


that
$20
million
annual
cap,
$5
million
must
be
reserved
for
29


tax
incentives
issued
to
housing
projects
located
in
small
30


cities,
as
defined
under
the
program.
The
program
also
limits
31


the
maximum
amount
of
tax
incentives
that
may
be
issued
per
32


housing
project
to
$1
million.
The
authority
is
required
33


to
issue
tax
incentives
under
the
program
on
a
first-come,
34


first-served
basis,

BILL
CHANGES.
The
bill
amends
language
relating
to
the
6


acceptance
of
housing
project
applications
by
the
authority.
7


Current
law
states
that
the
authority
may
accept
applications
8


on
a
continuous
basis.
The
bill
states
that
the
authority
may
9


accept
applications
during
one
or
more
application
periods,
and
10


provides
that
housing
project
applications
shall
be
reviewed
11


and
scored
on
a
competitive
basis
by
the
authority
pursuant
to
12


rules
adopted
by
the
authority.
13


The
bill
removes
registration
of
housing
projects
from
the
14


program,
and
provides
that
the
authority
may
make
tax
incentive
15


awards
to
housing
projects.
Tax
incentive
awards
shall
be
16


subject
to
the
approval
of
the
director
of
the
authority.
17


Applicants
who
are
unsuccessful
in
receiving
a
tax
incentive
18


award
are
authorized
under
the
bill
to
make
additional
19


applications
for
that
housing
project
during
subsequent
20


application
periods.
In
determining
the
tax
incentive
award
21


of
a
particular
housing
project,
the
authority
shall
not
use
22


an
amount
of
housing
project
costs
that
exceeds
the
amount
23


included
in
the
housing
project
application.
24


The
bill
requires
the
authority
to
notify
the
housing
25


business
of
its
tax
incentive
award.
The
notification
must
26


include
a
statement
that
the
housing
business
has
no
right
to
27


receive
a
tax
incentive
certificate
or
claim
a
tax
incentive


28


until
all
requirements
of
the
program
and
the
tax
incentive
29


agreement
are
satisfied.
30


The
bill
amends
the
requirements
related
to
the
tax
31


incentive
agreement
entered
into
by
the
authority
and
a
32


housing
business
to
provide
that
such
agreement
shall
identify
33


the
tax
incentive
award,
the
tax
incentive
award
date,
the
34


project
completion
deadline,
and

total

The
bill
provides
that,
upon
verification
by
the
authority
2


of
the

costs
and
qualifying
new
investment
as
required
3


by
current

the

may

which
contains

a

The

10


The
bill
also
amends
the
definition
of
“small
city”
for
11


purposes
of
the
program.
Under
current
law,
the
definition
12


of
“small
city”
includes
any
city
or
township
not
located
13


within
the
11
most
populous
counties
in
the
state.
When
a
14


city
is
located
in
more
than
one
county,
it
is
considered
15


to
be
located
in
the
county
having
the
greatest
taxable
base
16


within
the
city.
The
bill
amends
“small
city”
to
include
any
17


city
or
township
not
located
wholly
within
one
or
more
of
the
18


11
most
populous
counties
in
the
state.
In
other
words,
any
19


city
or
township
located
in
whole
or
in
part
in
one
of
the
88
20


least
populated
counties
in
Iowa
will
qualify
as
a
small
city
21


under
the
program.
The
definition
is
also
amended
to
provide
22


that
population
is
computed
using
the
most
recent
population
23


estimates
issued
by
the
United
States
census
bureau,
instead
of
24


the
most
recent
federal
decennial
census.
25


The
bill
amends
requirements
relating
to
the
termination
26


and
repayment
of
tax
incentives
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
27


requirements
of
the
program
to
provide
that
such
failures
to
28


comply
with
the
program
may
also
result
in
the
revocation
of
29


the
tax
incentive
award.


30


The
bill
amends
language
relating
to
the
calculation
of
the
31


amount
of
tax
incentives
for
which
a
housing
project
qualifies.
32


Under
current
law,
the
amount
of
the
sales
and
use

refunds
33


is
calculated
using
the
taxes
directly
related
to
a

The

provides
that

more
11


than
$20
million
in
tax
incentives
each
fiscal
year

shall

With
regard
15


to
housing
projects
registered
prior
to
July
1,
2018,
the
bill
16


states
that
a
tax

will
be

awarded
when
17


the
authority
enters
into
a
tax
incentive
agreement
for
that
18

states
that
a

has
no
right
to
enter
into
a

tax
incentive
agreement
for
such
a

project
until
the

allocates

project
and
22


notifies
the
housing
business
that
the

is
measured

The

19


further
modifies
the

that
the
