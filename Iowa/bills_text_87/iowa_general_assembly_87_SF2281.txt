  3 30 provision or application, and to this end the provisions of
  3 31 this Act are severable.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  3  7 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than
  3  8 thirty days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  3  9    4.  A physician shall retain in the woman's medical record
  3 10 all of the following:

  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.

  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be

  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall

  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,

  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman

  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion

  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to

  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30

  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.

  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in

  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"

  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception

  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any

  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion

  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to

  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30

  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any

  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be

  3 26    Sec. 5.  SEVERABILITY CLAUSE.  If any provision of this Act

  3 28 the invalidity does not affect other provisions of applications
  3 29 of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid
  3 30 provision or application, and to this end the provisions of
  3 31 this Act are severable.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  3 22 performed in violation of this section.
  3 23    6.  The board of medicine shall adopt rules pursuant to
  3 24 chapter 17A to administer this section.
  3 25    Sec. 4.  REPEAL.  Chapter 146B, Code 2018, is repealed.
  3 26    Sec. 5.  SEVERABILITY CLAUSE.  If any provision of this Act
  3 27 or its application to a person or circumstance is held invalid,
  3 28 the invalidity does not affect other provisions of applications
  3 29 of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid
  3 30 provision or application, and to this end the provisions of
  3 31 this Act are severable.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall

  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"

  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall

  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of

  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.

  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of

  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  3 31 this Act are severable.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  2 27    2.  A physician shall not perform an abortion upon a pregnant
  2 28 woman when it has been determined that the unborn child has
  2 29 a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the physician's
  2 30 reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency exists.
  2 31    3.  a.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  2 32 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  2 33 pursuant to subsection 2 that the unborn child has a detectable
  2 34 fetal heartbeat and a medical emergency does not exist, is

  3  2 subsection may request a hearing before the board of medicine
  3  3 to determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated

  3  5 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  3  6 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  3  7 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than
  3  8 thirty days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  3  9    4.  A physician shall retain in the woman's medical record
  3 10 all of the following:
  3 11    a.  Documentation of the testing for a fetal heartbeat
  3 12 as specified in subsection 1 and the results of the fetal
  3 13 heartbeat test.
  3 14    b.  The pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that
  3 15 the pregnant woman received the information as required under
  3 16 subsection 1.
  3 17    c.  Any information entered into evidence by the physician in
  3 18 any hearing before the board of medicine pursuant to subsection
  3 19 3.
  3 20    5.  This section shall not be construed to impose civil
  3 21 or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is
  3 22 performed in violation of this section.

  3 27 or its application to a person or circumstance is held invalid,
  3 28 the invalidity does not affect other provisions of applications
  3 29 of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid
  3 30 provision or application, and to this end the provisions of

  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable

  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"

  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the

  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in

  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the

  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and
  5 34 to this end the provisions of this bill are severable.

  3 29 of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid

  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable

  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion

  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"

  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.

  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules

  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.

  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect

  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following

  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical

  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides

  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be
  5 33 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and

  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable

  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more

  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.

  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to prerequisites for and prohibitions
  4  1 against  abortions relative to the testing for, and following
  4  2 the detection of, a fetal heartbeat.
  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.
  5 11    The bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal
  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be

  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman
  4 18 shall sign a form acknowledging that the pregnant woman has
  4 19 received the information.
  4 20    The bill prohibits a physician from performing an abortion
  4 21 upon a pregnant woman when it has been determined that the
  4 22 unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat, unless, in the
  4 23 physician's reasonable medical judgment, a medical emergency
  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
  4 28 felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  4 29 more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more
  4 30 than $7,500.
  4 31    A physician charged or indicted for a violation under the
  4 32 bill may request a  hearing before the board of medicine to
  4 33 determine if a medical emergency existed that necessitated the
  4 34 performance of the abortion.  The findings of the board of
  4 35 medicine are admissible on the issue of medical emergency in
  5  1 any criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of the physician, the
  5  2 court shall delay any criminal proceedings for not more than 30
  5  3 days to permit such a hearing to be held.
  5  4    The bill requires the physician to retain in the woman's
  5  5 medical record documentation of the testing for a fetal
  5  6 heartbeat and the results of the fetal heartbeat test; the
  5  7 pregnant woman's signed form acknowledging that the pregnant
  5  8 woman received the required information prescribed under
  5  9 the bill; and any information entered into evidence by the
  5 10 physician in any hearing before the board of medicine.

  5 12 liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in
  5 13 violation of the bill.
  5 14    The bill requires the board of medicine to adopt rules
  5 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A to administer the bill.
  5 16    The bill amends Code section 146A.1 to provide that the
  5 17 prerequisites of that Code section do not apply to an abortion
  5 18 performed in a medical emergency, and eliminates the exception
  5 19 for an abortion performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.
  5 20 The bill also amends the definition of "medical emergency" used
  5 21 under Code chapter 146A to be consistent with the definition of
  5 22 "medical emergency" used in the bill.
  5 23    The bill repeals Code chapter 146B which provides
  5 24 limitations on and prerequisites for an abortion including
  5 25 determination of the postfertilization age of a fetus and the
  5 26 prohibition against performing or attempting to perform an
  5 27 abortion after a pregnancy reaches a postfertilization age of
  5 28 20 or more weeks that conflict with the bill.
  5 29    The bill includes a severability clause that if any
  5 30 provision of this bill or its application to a person or
  5 31 circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
  5 32 other provisions of applications of this bill which can be

  4  3    The bill provides that, except in the case of a medical
  4  4 emergency, a physician shall not perform an abortion unless the
  4  5 physician has first complied with the prerequisites of Code
  4  6 chapter 146A and has tested the pregnant woman to determine if
  4  7 a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The bill prescribes that in
  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.
  4 17 Upon receipt of the written information, the pregnant woman

  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"

  4  8 testing for a detectable fetal heartbeat, the physician shall
  4  9 perform an abdominal ultrasound, necessary to detect a fetal
  4 10 heartbeat according to standard medical practice and including
  4 11 the use of medical devices, as determined by standard medical
  4 12 practice and specified by rule of the board of medicine.
  4 13    Following the testing of the pregnant woman for a detectable
  4 14 fetal heartbeat, the physician shall inform the pregnant woman,
  4 15 in writing, whether a fetal heartbeat was detected and that
  4 16 if a fetal heartbeat was detected, an abortion is prohibited.

  4 24 exists.  A physician who knowingly and intentionally performs
  4 25 an abortion on a pregnant woman, when it has been determined
  4 26 that the unborn child has a detectable fetal heartbeat and a
  4 27 medical emergency does not exist, is guilty of a class "D"
