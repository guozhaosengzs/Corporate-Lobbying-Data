  2 35 conservation plan or soil conservation agreement.  However,
  3  1 a plan may cover one or more farm units as specified in the

  3  4 practices or farming practices that manage nutrients and
  3  5 reduces contributing contaminant loads to receiving surface
  3  6 waters as required under this section.
  3  7    4.  The water quality plan shall be completed on forms
  3  8 prepared by the division in consultation with the Iowa nutrient
  3  9 research center established pursuant to section 466B.47.
  3 10 The plan shall be based on an analysis of the nutrient loss
  3 11 potential of a farm's farming practices and water quality
  3 12 practices by the water quality model established by the Iowa
  3 13 nutrient research center pursuant to section 466B.50.  The plan
  3 14 must provide that the farm unit's nutrient load contribution to
  3 15 surface water sources shall not exceed its assigned tolerance
  3 16 values for nitrogen or phosphorus.  The plan shall account for
  3 17 all of the following:
  3 18    a.  The location of each field and its size in acres.
  3 19    b.  The proximity of the field to a water source, including
  3 20 any major water source.
  3 21    c.  The amount and timing of nutrients or commercial

  3 26 whether the animal feeding operation is a confinement feeding
  3 27 operation as defined in section 459.102 or an open feedlot
  3 28 operation as defined in section 459A.102. For each animal
  3 29 feeding operation, the plan shall state the type of animals
  3 30 confined, and the animal unit capacity of the operation.
  3 31    f.  The maintenance of any water quality practice, soil and
  3 32 water conservation practice, or erosion control practice.

  3 35 erosion in excess of the applicable soil loss limits.
  4  1    i.  The predicted loads of nitrogen and phosphorus
  4  2 respectively contributed to a surface water source, including
  4  3 a major water source, and the extent that such loads are less
  4  4 than the tolerance values assigned to that farm unit.
  4  5    j.  The results of a test conducted according to a schedule
  4  6 adopted in the plan that indicates the average loads of
  4  7 nitrogen and phosphorus respectively being contributed to a
  4  8 surface water source, including a major water source.  The test
  4  9 shall be conducted by the division, the commissioners, or a
  4 10 person approved by the division or the commissioners.
  4 11    5.  The commissioners shall ensure that a person receiving
  4 12 financial assistance under this chapter is complying with the
  4 13 terms and conditions of the water quality plan.

  4 15 agricultural land covered by a water quality plan, if
  4 16 reasonable grounds exist to believe that a failure to comply
  4 17 with the plan is occurring. If the commissioners determine
  4 18 a failure is occurring, a notice of that finding shall be
  4 19 delivered to the person who filed the plan, to the landowner or
  4 20 landowners of record, and to each occupant of the agricultural
  4 21 land if known to the commissioners.  The notice shall describe
  4 22 the agricultural land affected and shall describe the failure.
  4 23 The notice shall also describe the corrective action required
  4 24 and the time limit for commencing and accomplishing such

  4 28 shall issue an administrative order to the person who filed the
  4 29 water quality plan.  The administrative order shall address the
  4 30 same subjects provided in the notice.  However, the corrective
  4 31 action must be commenced not more than six months after the
  4 32 date the order is issued and must be completed not more than

  4 35 to issue an order requiring immediate compliance with an
  5  1 administrative order if the commissioners have determined any
  5  2 of the following:
  5  3    a.  The corrective action has not been commenced or completed
  5  4 by the date specified in the administrative order.
