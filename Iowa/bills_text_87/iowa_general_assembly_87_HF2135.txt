  2 35    c.  An estimate of all expenditures from the animal
  3  1 agriculture compliance fund to be expended for reasonable
  3  2 direct and indirect costs of fully administering and enforcing
  3  3 this chapter.
  3  4    2.  The department shall invite interested persons to
  3  5 participate as stakeholders and convene an annual stakeholder
  3  6 meeting prior to June 1 to review the department's proposed
  3  7 budget for the following fiscal year.  The department shall
  3  8 consider any recommendations of the stakeholders when computing
  3  9 its final budget for the following fiscal year.  A person
  3 10 attending a stakeholder meeting is not entitled to receive
  3 11 a per diem as specified in section 7E.6 and shall not be
  3 12 reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending the meeting.
  3 13    3.  Notwithstanding section 459.400, the department

  3 17 stakeholders at the annual stakeholder meeting.
  3 18    4.  The department shall prepare a report to be submitted
  3 19 to the governor and general assembly not later than January
  3 20 3, 2020, that recommends the appropriate amount of moneys
  3 21 required to pay for all reasonable direct and indirect costs of
  3 22 administering and enforcing this chapter.
  3 23    Sec. 3.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate
  3 24 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  3 29 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulated by the department of
  3 30 natural resources (DNR) by establishing a moratorium upon the
  3 31 construction, including expansion, of a confinement feeding
  3 32 operation structure (structure) such as buildings or manure
  3 33 storage structure associated with a confinement feeding
  3 34 operation (operation). The degree of regulation is based on
  3 35 a number of factors including the date the operations were
  4  1 established, the type of structure being constructed, and
  4  2 the operation's size determined according to its animal unit
  4  3 capacity (AUC).  The bill also requires DNR to establish
  4  4 an annual budget that provides for fully administering
  4  5 and enforcing the Code chapter, including by adjusting the
  4  6 statutory amount assessed for each compliance fee (fee) that is
  4  7 deposited in the animal agriculture compliance fund (fund).
  4  8    MORATORIUM.  The moratorium applies to DNR's acceptance or
  4  9 approval of applications for permits to construct a structure
  4 10 and to the construction of such structure (when concrete
  4 11 is poured to form its floor or foundation) regardless of
  4 12 whether a permit has been issued. A number of exceptions
  4 13 apply, including for operations having an AUC of 300 or fewer
  4 14 animal units, dry bedded confinement feeding operations (where
  4 15 manure is stored as dry bedded manure rather than liquid), the
  4 16 construction of an egg washwater storage structure, and the
  4 17 construction of a structure pursuant to a variance granted by
  4 18 DNR for a replacement structure so long as the operation's
  4 19 AUC or its manure storage capacity is not increased, and the
  4 20 structure provides a higher degree of environmental protection
  4 21 than the replaced structure.
  4 22    DNR ANNUAL BUDGET AND REPORT.  The bill requires DNR to
  4 23 prepare an estimated budget that calculates the total amount
  4 24 of moneys appropriated and available to fully fund DNR's
  4 25 administration and enforcement of the Code chapter for each
  4 26 fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018. The estimated
  4 27 budget must include any necessary adjustment to the amount of
  4 28 fees it assesses for deposit in the fund. DNR is required to
  4 29 conduct an annual stakeholder meeting held prior to June 1 of
  4 30 each year in order to consider DNR's estimated budget which
  4 31 becomes final on July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year.
  4 32 DNR must submit a report to the governor and general assembly
  4 33 by January 3, 2020, that includes a recommendation for an
  4 34 appropriate funding level.
  4 35    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates subchapter III
  5  1 of the Code chapter, regulating water quality, is subject to
  5  2 a range of civil penalties not to exceed $10,000, which is
  5  3 administratively enforced by DNR under  the Iowa administrative
  5  4 procedures Act (Code chapter 17A).  Alternatively, a judicial
  5  5 action may be brought against a person by the attorney general
  5  6 with a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  5  7 violation (Code section 459.603 referring to Code sections
  5  8 455B.109 and 455B.191).
  5  9    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  5 10 enactment.

  3 30 natural resources (DNR) by establishing a moratorium upon the
  3 31 construction, including expansion, of a confinement feeding
  3 32 operation structure (structure) such as buildings or manure
  3 33 storage structure associated with a confinement feeding
  3 34 operation (operation). The degree of regulation is based on
  3 35 a number of factors including the date the operations were
  4  1 established, the type of structure being constructed, and
  4  2 the operation's size determined according to its animal unit
  4  3 capacity (AUC).  The bill also requires DNR to establish
  4  4 an annual budget that provides for fully administering
  4  5 and enforcing the Code chapter, including by adjusting the
  4  6 statutory amount assessed for each compliance fee (fee) that is
  4  7 deposited in the animal agriculture compliance fund (fund).
  4  8    MORATORIUM.  The moratorium applies to DNR's acceptance or
  4  9 approval of applications for permits to construct a structure
  4 10 and to the construction of such structure (when concrete
  4 11 is poured to form its floor or foundation) regardless of
  4 12 whether a permit has been issued. A number of exceptions
  4 13 apply, including for operations having an AUC of 300 or fewer
  4 14 animal units, dry bedded confinement feeding operations (where
  4 15 manure is stored as dry bedded manure rather than liquid), the
  4 16 construction of an egg washwater storage structure, and the
  4 17 construction of a structure pursuant to a variance granted by
  4 18 DNR for a replacement structure so long as the operation's
  4 19 AUC or its manure storage capacity is not increased, and the
  4 20 structure provides a higher degree of environmental protection
  4 21 than the replaced structure.
  4 22    DNR ANNUAL BUDGET AND REPORT.  The bill requires DNR to
  4 23 prepare an estimated budget that calculates the total amount
  4 24 of moneys appropriated and available to fully fund DNR's
  4 25 administration and enforcement of the Code chapter for each
  4 26 fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018. The estimated
  4 27 budget must include any necessary adjustment to the amount of
  4 28 fees it assesses for deposit in the fund. DNR is required to
  4 29 conduct an annual stakeholder meeting held prior to June 1 of
  4 30 each year in order to consider DNR's estimated budget which
  4 31 becomes final on July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year.
  4 32 DNR must submit a report to the governor and general assembly
  4 33 by January 3, 2020, that includes a recommendation for an
  4 34 appropriate funding level.
  4 35    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates subchapter III
  5  1 of the Code chapter, regulating water quality, is subject to
  5  2 a range of civil penalties not to exceed $10,000, which is
  5  3 administratively enforced by DNR under  the Iowa administrative
  5  4 procedures Act (Code chapter 17A).  Alternatively, a judicial
  5  5 action may be brought against a person by the attorney general
  5  6 with a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  5  7 violation (Code section 459.603 referring to Code sections
  5  8 455B.109 and 455B.191).
  5  9    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  5 10 enactment.

  3 25                           EXPLANATION
  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  3 29 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulated by the department of
  3 30 natural resources (DNR) by establishing a moratorium upon the
  3 31 construction, including expansion, of a confinement feeding
  3 32 operation structure (structure) such as buildings or manure
  3 33 storage structure associated with a confinement feeding
  3 34 operation (operation). The degree of regulation is based on
  3 35 a number of factors including the date the operations were
  4  1 established, the type of structure being constructed, and
  4  2 the operation's size determined according to its animal unit
  4  3 capacity (AUC).  The bill also requires DNR to establish
  4  4 an annual budget that provides for fully administering
  4  5 and enforcing the Code chapter, including by adjusting the
  4  6 statutory amount assessed for each compliance fee (fee) that is
  4  7 deposited in the animal agriculture compliance fund (fund).
  4  8    MORATORIUM.  The moratorium applies to DNR's acceptance or
  4  9 approval of applications for permits to construct a structure
  4 10 and to the construction of such structure (when concrete
  4 11 is poured to form its floor or foundation) regardless of
  4 12 whether a permit has been issued. A number of exceptions
  4 13 apply, including for operations having an AUC of 300 or fewer
  4 14 animal units, dry bedded confinement feeding operations (where
  4 15 manure is stored as dry bedded manure rather than liquid), the
  4 16 construction of an egg washwater storage structure, and the
  4 17 construction of a structure pursuant to a variance granted by
  4 18 DNR for a replacement structure so long as the operation's
  4 19 AUC or its manure storage capacity is not increased, and the
  4 20 structure provides a higher degree of environmental protection
  4 21 than the replaced structure.
  4 22    DNR ANNUAL BUDGET AND REPORT.  The bill requires DNR to
  4 23 prepare an estimated budget that calculates the total amount
  4 24 of moneys appropriated and available to fully fund DNR's
  4 25 administration and enforcement of the Code chapter for each
  4 26 fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018. The estimated
  4 27 budget must include any necessary adjustment to the amount of
  4 28 fees it assesses for deposit in the fund. DNR is required to
  4 29 conduct an annual stakeholder meeting held prior to June 1 of
  4 30 each year in order to consider DNR's estimated budget which
  4 31 becomes final on July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year.
  4 32 DNR must submit a report to the governor and general assembly
  4 33 by January 3, 2020, that includes a recommendation for an
  4 34 appropriate funding level.
  4 35    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates subchapter III
  5  1 of the Code chapter, regulating water quality, is subject to
  5  2 a range of civil penalties not to exceed $10,000, which is
  5  3 administratively enforced by DNR under  the Iowa administrative
  5  4 procedures Act (Code chapter 17A).  Alternatively, a judicial
  5  5 action may be brought against a person by the attorney general
  5  6 with a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  5  7 violation (Code section 459.603 referring to Code sections
  5  8 455B.109 and 455B.191).

  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  3 29 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulated by the department of
  3 30 natural resources (DNR) by establishing a moratorium upon the
  3 31 construction, including expansion, of a confinement feeding
  3 32 operation structure (structure) such as buildings or manure
  3 33 storage structure associated with a confinement feeding
  3 34 operation (operation). The degree of regulation is based on
  3 35 a number of factors including the date the operations were
  4  1 established, the type of structure being constructed, and
  4  2 the operation's size determined according to its animal unit
  4  3 capacity (AUC).  The bill also requires DNR to establish
  4  4 an annual budget that provides for fully administering
  4  5 and enforcing the Code chapter, including by adjusting the
  4  6 statutory amount assessed for each compliance fee (fee) that is
  4  7 deposited in the animal agriculture compliance fund (fund).
  4  8    MORATORIUM.  The moratorium applies to DNR's acceptance or
  4  9 approval of applications for permits to construct a structure
  4 10 and to the construction of such structure (when concrete
  4 11 is poured to form its floor or foundation) regardless of
  4 12 whether a permit has been issued. A number of exceptions
  4 13 apply, including for operations having an AUC of 300 or fewer
  4 14 animal units, dry bedded confinement feeding operations (where
  4 15 manure is stored as dry bedded manure rather than liquid), the
  4 16 construction of an egg washwater storage structure, and the
  4 17 construction of a structure pursuant to a variance granted by
  4 18 DNR for a replacement structure so long as the operation's
  4 19 AUC or its manure storage capacity is not increased, and the
  4 20 structure provides a higher degree of environmental protection
  4 21 than the replaced structure.

  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  3 29 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulated by the department of
  3 30 natural resources (DNR) by establishing a moratorium upon the
  3 31 construction, including expansion, of a confinement feeding
  3 32 operation structure (structure) such as buildings or manure
  3 33 storage structure associated with a confinement feeding
  3 34 operation (operation). The degree of regulation is based on
  3 35 a number of factors including the date the operations were
  4  1 established, the type of structure being constructed, and
  4  2 the operation's size determined according to its animal unit
  4  3 capacity (AUC).  The bill also requires DNR to establish
  4  4 an annual budget that provides for fully administering
  4  5 and enforcing the Code chapter, including by adjusting the
  4  6 statutory amount assessed for each compliance fee (fee) that is
  4  7 deposited in the animal agriculture compliance fund (fund).
  4  8    MORATORIUM.  The moratorium applies to DNR's acceptance or
  4  9 approval of applications for permits to construct a structure
  4 10 and to the construction of such structure (when concrete
  4 11 is poured to form its floor or foundation) regardless of
  4 12 whether a permit has been issued. A number of exceptions
  4 13 apply, including for operations having an AUC of 300 or fewer
  4 14 animal units, dry bedded confinement feeding operations (where
  4 15 manure is stored as dry bedded manure rather than liquid), the
  4 16 construction of an egg washwater storage structure, and the
  4 17 construction of a structure pursuant to a variance granted by
  4 18 DNR for a replacement structure so long as the operation's
  4 19 AUC or its manure storage capacity is not increased, and the
  4 20 structure provides a higher degree of environmental protection
  4 21 than the replaced structure.
  4 22    DNR ANNUAL BUDGET AND REPORT.  The bill requires DNR to
  4 23 prepare an estimated budget that calculates the total amount
  4 24 of moneys appropriated and available to fully fund DNR's
  4 25 administration and enforcement of the Code chapter for each
  4 26 fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018. The estimated
  4 27 budget must include any necessary adjustment to the amount of
  4 28 fees it assesses for deposit in the fund. DNR is required to
  4 29 conduct an annual stakeholder meeting held prior to June 1 of
  4 30 each year in order to consider DNR's estimated budget which
  4 31 becomes final on July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year.
  4 32 DNR must submit a report to the governor and general assembly

  4 22    DNR ANNUAL BUDGET AND REPORT.  The bill requires DNR to
  4 23 prepare an estimated budget that calculates the total amount
  4 24 of moneys appropriated and available to fully fund DNR's
  4 25 administration and enforcement of the Code chapter for each
  4 26 fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018. The estimated
  4 27 budget must include any necessary adjustment to the amount of
  4 28 fees it assesses for deposit in the fund. DNR is required to
  4 29 conduct an annual stakeholder meeting held prior to June 1 of
  4 30 each year in order to consider DNR's estimated budget which
  4 31 becomes final on July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year.
  4 32 DNR must submit a report to the governor and general assembly
  4 33 by January 3, 2020, that includes a recommendation for an
  4 34 appropriate funding level.
  4 35    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates subchapter III
  5  1 of the Code chapter, regulating water quality, is subject to
  5  2 a range of civil penalties not to exceed $10,000, which is
  5  3 administratively enforced by DNR under  the Iowa administrative

  4 22    DNR ANNUAL BUDGET AND REPORT.  The bill requires DNR to
  4 23 prepare an estimated budget that calculates the total amount
  4 24 of moneys appropriated and available to fully fund DNR's
  4 25 administration and enforcement of the Code chapter for each
  4 26 fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018. The estimated
  4 27 budget must include any necessary adjustment to the amount of
  4 28 fees it assesses for deposit in the fund. DNR is required to
  4 29 conduct an annual stakeholder meeting held prior to June 1 of
  4 30 each year in order to consider DNR's estimated budget which
  4 31 becomes final on July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year.

  4 34 appropriate funding level.
  4 35    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates subchapter III
  5  1 of the Code chapter, regulating water quality, is subject to
  5  2 a range of civil penalties not to exceed $10,000, which is
  5  3 administratively enforced by DNR under  the Iowa administrative

  3 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 28    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  3 29 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulated by the department of
  3 30 natural resources (DNR) by establishing a moratorium upon the
  3 31 construction, including expansion, of a confinement feeding
  3 32 operation structure (structure) such as buildings or manure
  3 33 storage structure associated with a confinement feeding
  3 34 operation (operation). The degree of regulation is based on
  3 35 a number of factors including the date the operations were
  4  1 established, the type of structure being constructed, and
  4  2 the operation's size determined according to its animal unit
  4  3 capacity (AUC).  The bill also requires DNR to establish
  4  4 an annual budget that provides for fully administering
  4  5 and enforcing the Code chapter, including by adjusting the
  4  6 statutory amount assessed for each compliance fee (fee) that is
  4  7 deposited in the animal agriculture compliance fund (fund).
  4  8    MORATORIUM.  The moratorium applies to DNR's acceptance or
  4  9 approval of applications for permits to construct a structure
  4 10 and to the construction of such structure (when concrete
  4 11 is poured to form its floor or foundation) regardless of
  4 12 whether a permit has been issued. A number of exceptions
  4 13 apply, including for operations having an AUC of 300 or fewer
  4 14 animal units, dry bedded confinement feeding operations (where
  4 15 manure is stored as dry bedded manure rather than liquid), the
  4 16 construction of an egg washwater storage structure, and the
  4 17 construction of a structure pursuant to a variance granted by
  4 18 DNR for a replacement structure so long as the operation's
