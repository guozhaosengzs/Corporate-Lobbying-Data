  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions in the "Animal
  2 31 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which currently
  2 32 requires that when the department of natural resources (DNR)
  2 33 receives an application for a permit to construct (including
  2 34 expand) a structure which is to be part of a confinement
  2 35 feeding operation sometimes referred to as a "concentrated
  3  1 animal feeding operation" (CAFO), it must deliver the
  3  2 application to the board of supervisors (board) in the county
  3  3 where the structure is proposed to be located.  Currently, the
  3  4 board may become involved in the application approval process
  3  5 by conducting a public hearing and submitting comments from its
  3  6 members and the public to DNR within 30 days from the date DNR
  3  7 received the application (Code sections 459.303 and 459.304).
  3  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill requires that the application
  3  9 include the name of one or more project managers responsible
  3 10 for siting and constructing the CAFO structure.  The board may
  3 11 require the applicant to select a project manager named in the
  3 12 application to attend the public hearing and participate by
  3 13 explaining the application, stating a position regarding the
  3 14 application, and answering questions.  The project manager's
  3 15 comments may be submitted to DNR with the other comments.  It
  3 16 is presumed that the project manager attended and participated
  3 17 in the public hearing. The board may submit evidence that a
  3 18 project manager did not attend or participate in the public
  3 19 hearing. If the board satisfies DNR that these requirements
  3 20 were not satisfied, DNR cannot approve the application.
  3 21    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  3 22 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  3 23 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  3 24 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  3 25 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  3 26 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  3 27 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  3 28 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  3 29 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  3 30 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3 31 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3 32 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3 33 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3 34 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3 35 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must
  4  1 provide relevant information about the applicant, the proposed
  4  2 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing
  4  3 (Code section 459.304).
  4  4    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  4  5 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  4  6 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  4  7 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  4  8 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  4  9 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  4 10 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  4 11 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  4 12 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  4 13 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  4 14 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  4 15 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs, a special equivalency
  4 16 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  4 17 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  4 18 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs.  For purposes
  4 19 of calculating the permit threshold for a CAFO maintaining such
  4 20 swine the AU capacity must equal a minimum of 2,500 (1,000 ?
  4 21 0.4 = 2,500).
  4 22    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  4 23 that date.

  4  2 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing
  4  3 (Code section 459.304).
  4  4    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  4  5 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  4  6 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  4  7 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  4  8 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  4  9 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  4 10 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  4 11 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  4 12 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  4 13 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  4 14 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  4 15 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs, a special equivalency
  4 16 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  4 17 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  4 18 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs.  For purposes
  4 19 of calculating the permit threshold for a CAFO maintaining such
  4 20 swine the AU capacity must equal a minimum of 2,500 (1,000 ?
  4 21 0.4 = 2,500).

  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions in the "Animal
  2 31 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which currently
  2 32 requires that when the department of natural resources (DNR)
  2 33 receives an application for a permit to construct (including
  2 34 expand) a structure which is to be part of a confinement
  2 35 feeding operation sometimes referred to as a "concentrated
  3  1 animal feeding operation" (CAFO), it must deliver the
  3  2 application to the board of supervisors (board) in the county
  3  3 where the structure is proposed to be located.  Currently, the
  3  4 board may become involved in the application approval process
  3  5 by conducting a public hearing and submitting comments from its
  3  6 members and the public to DNR within 30 days from the date DNR
  3  7 received the application (Code sections 459.303 and 459.304).
  3  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill requires that the application
  3  9 include the name of one or more project managers responsible
  3 10 for siting and constructing the CAFO structure.  The board may
  3 11 require the applicant to select a project manager named in the
  3 12 application to attend the public hearing and participate by
  3 13 explaining the application, stating a position regarding the
  3 14 application, and answering questions.  The project manager's
  3 15 comments may be submitted to DNR with the other comments.  It
  3 16 is presumed that the project manager attended and participated
  3 17 in the public hearing. The board may submit evidence that a
  3 18 project manager did not attend or participate in the public
  3 19 hearing. If the board satisfies DNR that these requirements
  3 20 were not satisfied, DNR cannot approve the application.
  3 21    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  3 22 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  3 23 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  3 24 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  3 25 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  3 26 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  3 27 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  3 28 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  3 29 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  3 30 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3 31 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3 32 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3 33 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3 34 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3 35 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must

  3  7 received the application (Code sections 459.303 and 459.304).
  3  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill requires that the application
  3  9 include the name of one or more project managers responsible
  3 10 for siting and constructing the CAFO structure.  The board may
  3 11 require the applicant to select a project manager named in the
  3 12 application to attend the public hearing and participate by
  3 13 explaining the application, stating a position regarding the
  3 14 application, and answering questions.  The project manager's
  3 15 comments may be submitted to DNR with the other comments.  It
  3 16 is presumed that the project manager attended and participated
  3 17 in the public hearing. The board may submit evidence that a
  3 18 project manager did not attend or participate in the public
  3 19 hearing. If the board satisfies DNR that these requirements
  3 20 were not satisfied, DNR cannot approve the application.
  3 21    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  3 22 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  3 23 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  3 24 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  3 25 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  3 26 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  3 27 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  3 28 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  3 29 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  3 30 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3 31 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3 32 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3 33 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3 34 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3 35 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must
  4  1 provide relevant information about the applicant, the proposed
  4  2 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing
  4  3 (Code section 459.304).
  4  4    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  4  5 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  4  6 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  4  7 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  4  8 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  4  9 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  4 10 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  4 11 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  4 12 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  4 13 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  4 14 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  4 15 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs, a special equivalency
  4 16 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  4 17 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  4 18 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs.  For purposes
  4 19 of calculating the permit threshold for a CAFO maintaining such
  4 20 swine the AU capacity must equal a minimum of 2,500 (1,000 ?
  4 21 0.4 = 2,500).
  4 22    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  4 23 that date.

  3 21    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  3 22 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  3 23 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  3 24 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  3 25 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  3 26 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  3 27 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  3 28 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  3 29 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  3 30 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3 31 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3 32 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3 33 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3 34 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3 35 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must
  4  1 provide relevant information about the applicant, the proposed
  4  2 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing
  4  3 (Code section 459.304).
  4  4    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  4  5 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  4  6 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  4  7 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  4  8 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  4  9 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  4 10 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  4 11 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  4 12 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  4 13 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  4 14 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  4 15 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs, a special equivalency
  4 16 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  4 17 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  4 18 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs.  For purposes
  4 19 of calculating the permit threshold for a CAFO maintaining such
  4 20 swine the AU capacity must equal a minimum of 2,500 (1,000 ?
  4 21 0.4 = 2,500).

  3  7 received the application (Code sections 459.303 and 459.304).
  3  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill requires that the application
  3  9 include the name of one or more project managers responsible
  3 10 for siting and constructing the CAFO structure.  The board may
  3 11 require the applicant to select a project manager named in the
  3 12 application to attend the public hearing and participate by
  3 13 explaining the application, stating a position regarding the
  3 14 application, and answering questions.  The project manager's
  3 15 comments may be submitted to DNR with the other comments.  It
  3 16 is presumed that the project manager attended and participated
  3 17 in the public hearing. The board may submit evidence that a
  3 18 project manager did not attend or participate in the public
  3 19 hearing. If the board satisfies DNR that these requirements
  3 20 were not satisfied, DNR cannot approve the application.
  3 21    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  3 22 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  3 23 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  3 24 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  3 25 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  3 26 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  3 27 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  3 28 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  3 29 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  3 30 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3 31 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3 32 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3 33 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3 34 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3 35 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must
  4  1 provide relevant information about the applicant, the proposed
  4  2 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing
  4  3 (Code section 459.304).
  4  4    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  4  5 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  4  6 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  4  7 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  4  8 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  4  9 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  4 10 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  4 11 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  4 12 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  4 13 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  4 14 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  4 15 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs, a special equivalency
  4 16 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  4 17 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  4 18 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs.  For purposes
  4 19 of calculating the permit threshold for a CAFO maintaining such
  4 20 swine the AU capacity must equal a minimum of 2,500 (1,000 ?
  4 21 0.4 = 2,500).
  4 22    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  4 23 that date.
