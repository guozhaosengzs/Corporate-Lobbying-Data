 10 34    Sec. 10.   10 34    Sec. 10.   10 35    1.  A law enforcement officer or animal control officer may
 11  1 rescue an animal from a stationary motor vehicle, including
 11  2 through the use of forced entrance, if the law enforcement
 11  3 officer or animal control officer reasonably believes that the
 11  4 animal may be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme
 11  5 interior temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The
 11  6 law enforcement officer's or animal control officer's action
 11  7 is justified regardless of whether the law enforcement officer
 11  8 or animal control officer observed indications of distress
 11  9 or whether the person could be charged with or convicted of
 11 10 committing a public offense.
 11 11    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer
 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.
 11 26    Sec. 11.  REPEAL.  Section 717B.8, Code 2018, is repealed.
 11 27    Sec. 12.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
 11 28 3, shall not apply to this Act.
 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11  1 rescue an animal from a stationary motor vehicle, including
 11  2 through the use of forced entrance, if the law enforcement
 11  3 officer or animal control officer reasonably believes that the
 11  4 animal may be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme
 11  5 interior temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The
 11  6 law enforcement officer's or animal control officer's action
 11  7 is justified regardless of whether the law enforcement officer
 11  8 or animal control officer observed indications of distress
 11  9 or whether the person could be charged with or convicted of
 11 10 committing a public offense.
 11 11    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer
 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,

 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11  2 through the use of forced entrance, if the law enforcement
 11  3 officer or animal control officer reasonably believes that the
 11  4 animal may be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme
 11  5 interior temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The
 11  6 law enforcement officer's or animal control officer's action
 11  7 is justified regardless of whether the law enforcement officer
 11  8 or animal control officer observed indications of distress
 11  9 or whether the person could be charged with or convicted of
 11 10 committing a public offense.
 11 11    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer
 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.
 11 26    Sec. 11.  REPEAL.  Section 717B.8, Code 2018, is repealed.
 11 27    Sec. 12.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
 11 28 3, shall not apply to this Act.

 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves

 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious

 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished

 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme

 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code

 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the

 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished

 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

       da/rj
 11  4 animal may be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme
 11  5 interior temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The
 11  6 law enforcement officer's or animal control officer's action
 11  7 is justified regardless of whether the law enforcement officer
 11  8 or animal control officer observed indications of distress
 11  9 or whether the person could be charged with or convicted of
 11 10 committing a public offense.
 11 11    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer
 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.
 11 26    Sec. 11.  REPEAL.  Section 717B.8, Code 2018, is repealed.
 11 27    Sec. 12.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
 11 28 3, shall not apply to this Act.
 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.

 11  7 is justified regardless of whether the law enforcement officer
 11  8 or animal control officer observed indications of distress
 11  9 or whether the person could be charged with or convicted of
 11 10 committing a public offense.
 11 11    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer
 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's

 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the

 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and

 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged

 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under

 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining

 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.
       LSB 2385SZ (4) 87
       da/rj
 11  7 is justified regardless of whether the law enforcement officer
 11  8 or animal control officer observed indications of distress
 11  9 or whether the person could be charged with or convicted of
 11 10 committing a public offense.
 11 11    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer
 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.
 11 26    Sec. 11.  REPEAL.  Section 717B.8, Code 2018, is repealed.
 11 27    Sec. 12.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
 11 28 3, shall not apply to this Act.
 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making

 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three

 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that

 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions

 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11  9 or whether the person could be charged with or convicted of
 11 10 committing a public offense.
 11 11    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal control officer
 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.

 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.

 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11 12 shall provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11 13 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11 14 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11 15 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11 16 be claimed.
 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.
 11 26    Sec. 11.  REPEAL.  Section 717B.8, Code 2018, is repealed.

 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly

 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making

 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court

 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local

 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining

 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and

 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where

 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three

 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11 17    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11 18 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 19 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 20 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.

 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.

 11 21 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 22 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,

 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11 23 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 24 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 25 the animal.

 11 28 3, shall not apply to this Act.
 11 29                           EXPLANATION
 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.

 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.

 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three

 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.

 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality

 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,

 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for

 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the

 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality

 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished

 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme

 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making

 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more

 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 11 32    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 33 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 34 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 35 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,

 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated

 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or

 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,

 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 12  1 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 12  2 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.

 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where

 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an

 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated

 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 12  3 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 12  4 481A.42).
 12  5    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local

 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or

 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making

 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been

 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the

 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged

 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury

 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites

 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme

 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where

 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class

 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

 12  6 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 22 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 23 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 24 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 25 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 26 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 27 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer
 15 15 must provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue,
 15 16 the animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 15 17 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 15 18 order.

       da/rj
 12  7 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND

 12  8 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 12  9 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12 10 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12 11 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12 12 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12 13 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12 14 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 21 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than

 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer

 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes

 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 33 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 28 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 29    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 30 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 15  5 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 15  6 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 15  7 is not less than 10 years.
 15  8    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND
 15  9 LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS.  The bill provides that a law
 15 10 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 15 11 or an animal control officer (a person employed by local
 15 12 government to enforce the animal control laws) is authorized to
 15 13 rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based upon a reasonable
 15 14 belief that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer

 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of

 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the

 12 15 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12 16 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 25 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 26 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 27 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 28 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 29 offenses.
 12 30    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 31 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 32 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites

 12 34 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 35 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 13  1 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 13  2 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 13  3 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 13  4 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 22 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 27 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 28 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 29 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 30 arrangements for the care of the animal.  There is also an
 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the
 14  3 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.
 14  6    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 14  7 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 14  8 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 14  9 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 14 10 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14 17 named offenses.
 14 18    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14 19 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14 20 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 31 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 32 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 33 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 34 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 35 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 15  1 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 15  2 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 15  3 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 15  4 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court

 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated

 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 25    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 26 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case

 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury

 12 17    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12 18 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 19 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 20 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 21 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 22 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 23 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 24 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of

 13  9 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13 10 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13 11    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13 12 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13 13 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13 14 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13 15 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13 16 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13 17 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13 18 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 19 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 20 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 21 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was

 13 23 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 24 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.

 13 31 exception for a person who removes a cat from a location
 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the

 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.

 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case

 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury

 13 32 and returns the cat to the same location after it has been
 13 33 sterilized. The criminal penalty is a simple misdemeanor.
 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the

 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.

 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury

 13  5 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 13  6 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 13  7 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 13  8 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case

 13 34 However, the penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if
 13 35 the animal suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor
 14  1 if the animal suffers a serious injury or death. In a case
 14  2 where the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the

 14  4 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 14  5 offenses.

 14 11 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 14 12 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14 13 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 14 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14 15 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14 16 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
