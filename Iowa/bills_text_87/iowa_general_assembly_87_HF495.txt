  3  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 10    GENERAL.  This bill extends the beginning farmer tax credit
  3 11 program established in 2013 which allows taxpayers holding
  3 12 agricultural land used for farming to claim two types of income
  3 13 tax credits:  (1) the agricultural assets transfer tax credit
  3 14 and (2) the custom farming contract tax credit.  The program
  3 15 is due to expire on January 1, 2018, and the bill extends that
  3 16 date five years to January 1, 2023.  On that same date, a
  3 17 former version of the agricultural assets transfer tax credit
  3 18 as it existed immediately prior to 2013 is restored with one
  3 19 exception.  The former version would incorporate a change made
  3 20 in the 2013 legislation which increased the carryforward period
  3 21 from five to 10 years.  When the program is eliminated and the
  3 22 former version of the agricultural assets transfer tax credit
  3 23 is restored, the available standing appropriation used to
  3 24 support the agricultural assets transfer tax credit is restored
  3 25 to the pre=2013 amount of $6 million, a reduction from $12
  3 26 million currently available to support both tax credits.
  3 27    BACKGROUND == PROGRAM.  A taxpayer who holds agricultural
  3 28 land which may include other assets (such as depreciable
  3 29 agricultural property, crops, or livestock), and who executes
  3 30 an agreement with a beginning farmer is entitled to claim a
  3 31 tax credit against individual or corporate tax liability (Code
  3 32 section 16.80).  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit
  3 33 is available to a taxpayer who assists a beginning farmer in
  3 34 acquiring agricultural assets (land by lease or equipment by
  3 35 rental agreement). The custom farming contract tax credit
  4  1 is available to a taxpayer who enters into a contract with
  4  2 a beginning farmer to perform custom work on agricultural
  4  3 land held by the taxpayer (Code section 16.81).  Generally,
  4  4 $8 million of the appropriated $12 million is allocated to
  4  5 support the agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the
  4  6 remaining $4 million is allocated to support the custom farming
  4  7 contract tax credit (Code section 16.82).  For the agricultural
  4  8 assets transfer tax credit, the tax credit percentages for cash
  4  9 rent and crop share agreements are 7 percent and 17 percent,
  4 10 respectively, with an additional 1 percent bonus provided for
  4 11 the first year of the agreement if the beginning farmer is
  4 12 a veteran.  Once the former agricultural assets transfer tax
  4 13 credit is restored, the tax credit percentages are reduced to 5
  4 14 and 15 percent, respectively, and without a veteran bonus.  For
  4 15 a custom farming contract tax credit, the tax credit percentage
  4 16 equals 7 percent of the value of the contract on a tax credit
  4 17 with an additional 1 percent bonus provided if the beginning
  4 18 farmer is a veteran. A taxpayer cannot claim a tax credit in
  4 19 excess of $50,000 under either program.  The restored version
  4 20 of the agricultural assets transfer tax credit does not limit
  4 21 the amount that a taxpayer may claim.
  4 22    BACKGROUND == ADMINISTRATION.  In 2013 and 2014, supervision
  4 23 of the program was transferred from the Iowa agricultural
  4 24 development authority to the Iowa finance authority and the
  4 25 relevant statutory provisions were transferred from Code
  4 26 chapter 175 to Code chapter 16 (2013 Iowa Acts, ch. 100, and
  4 27 2014 Iowa Acts, ch. 1080).

  3 28 land which may include other assets (such as depreciable

  3 30 an agreement with a beginning farmer is entitled to claim a

  3 33 is available to a taxpayer who assists a beginning farmer in
  3 34 acquiring agricultural assets (land by lease or equipment by
  3 35 rental agreement). The custom farming contract tax credit
  4  1 is available to a taxpayer who enters into a contract with
  4  2 a beginning farmer to perform custom work on agricultural
  4  3 land held by the taxpayer (Code section 16.81).  Generally,
  4  4 $8 million of the appropriated $12 million is allocated to
  4  5 support the agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the
  4  6 remaining $4 million is allocated to support the custom farming
  4  7 contract tax credit (Code section 16.82).  For the agricultural
  4  8 assets transfer tax credit, the tax credit percentages for cash
  4  9 rent and crop share agreements are 7 percent and 17 percent,
  4 10 respectively, with an additional 1 percent bonus provided for

  4 12 a veteran.  Once the former agricultural assets transfer tax
  4 13 credit is restored, the tax credit percentages are reduced to 5
  4 14 and 15 percent, respectively, and without a veteran bonus.  For

  3 27    BACKGROUND == PROGRAM.  A taxpayer who holds agricultural
  3 28 land which may include other assets (such as depreciable
  3 29 agricultural property, crops, or livestock), and who executes
  3 30 an agreement with a beginning farmer is entitled to claim a
  3 31 tax credit against individual or corporate tax liability (Code
  3 32 section 16.80).  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit
  3 33 is available to a taxpayer who assists a beginning farmer in
  3 34 acquiring agricultural assets (land by lease or equipment by
  3 35 rental agreement). The custom farming contract tax credit
  4  1 is available to a taxpayer who enters into a contract with
  4  2 a beginning farmer to perform custom work on agricultural
  4  3 land held by the taxpayer (Code section 16.81).  Generally,
  4  4 $8 million of the appropriated $12 million is allocated to
  4  5 support the agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the
  4  6 remaining $4 million is allocated to support the custom farming
  4  7 contract tax credit (Code section 16.82).  For the agricultural
  4  8 assets transfer tax credit, the tax credit percentages for cash
  4  9 rent and crop share agreements are 7 percent and 17 percent,
  4 10 respectively, with an additional 1 percent bonus provided for
  4 11 the first year of the agreement if the beginning farmer is
  4 12 a veteran.  Once the former agricultural assets transfer tax
  4 13 credit is restored, the tax credit percentages are reduced to 5
  4 14 and 15 percent, respectively, and without a veteran bonus.  For
  4 15 a custom farming contract tax credit, the tax credit percentage
  4 16 equals 7 percent of the value of the contract on a tax credit
  4 17 with an additional 1 percent bonus provided if the beginning
  4 18 farmer is a veteran. A taxpayer cannot claim a tax credit in
  4 19 excess of $50,000 under either program.  The restored version
  4 20 of the agricultural assets transfer tax credit does not limit
  4 21 the amount that a taxpayer may claim.

  4 23 of the program was transferred from the Iowa agricultural
  4 24 development authority to the Iowa finance authority and the
