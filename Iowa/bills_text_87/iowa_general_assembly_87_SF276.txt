  4 12    This bill concerns compensation payable under the victim

  4 14    Code section 915.80 is amended to add a definition for a

  5  6 transportation costs is amended to allow compensation for
  5  7 transportation to a funeral, memorial, or burial service.
  5  8    The bill adds a new provision to provide additional
  5  9 compensation of up to a total of $5,000 for qualifying
  5 10 compensable expenses under the Code section if the expenses
  5 11 were not eligible for compensation at the time the initial

  5 13 victim, or survivor of a deceased victim demonstrates that a
  5 14 denial of additional compensation would constitute an undue
  5 15 hardship; or additional compensable qualifying expenses are
  5 16 incurred following a new event.  The bill defines "new event"
