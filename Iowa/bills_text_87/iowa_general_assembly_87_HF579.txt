  9  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  4    This bill relates to criminal sentencing by modifying
  9  5 criminal penalties for cocaine base and attempted murder,
  9  6 making inapplicable certain provisions relating to mandatory
  9  7 sentences, mandatory minimum sentences, limitations on parole
  9  8 and work release, and limitations on earned time.
  9  9    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
  9 10 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
  9 11 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
  9 12 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
  9 13 or possesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a
  9 14 controlled substance containing cocaine base, or unlawfully
  9 15 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
  9 16 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  9 17 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  9 18 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  9 19 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  9 20 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100
  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  9 23 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a
  9 24 fine of not less than $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the
  9 25 controlled substance is more than 20 grams but not more than
  9 26 100 grams rather than the current more than 10 but not more
  9 27 than 50 grams; or a class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not
  9 28 less than $1,000 but not more than $50,000 if the controlled
  9 29 substance containing cocaine base is 20 grams or less rather
  9 30 than the current 10 grams or less.
  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9  9    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled

  9 11 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
  9 12 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
  9 13 or possesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a
  9 14 controlled substance containing cocaine base, or unlawfully
  9 15 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
  9 16 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  9 17 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  9 18 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  9 19 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  9 20 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100
  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  9 23 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a
  9 24 fine of not less than $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the
  9 25 controlled substance is more than 20 grams but not more than
  9 26 100 grams rather than the current more than 10 but not more
  9 27 than 50 grams; or a class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not
  9 28 less than $1,000 but not more than $50,000 if the controlled
  9 29 substance containing cocaine base is 20 grams or less rather
  9 30 than the current 10 grams or less.
  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for

 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.

 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling

 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code

 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9  8 and work release, and limitations on earned time.
  9  9    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
  9 10 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
  9 11 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
  9 12 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
  9 13 or possesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a
  9 14 controlled substance containing cocaine base, or unlawfully
  9 15 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
  9 16 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  9 17 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  9 18 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  9 19 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  9 20 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100
  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  9 23 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a
  9 24 fine of not less than $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the
  9 25 controlled substance is more than 20 grams but not more than
  9 26 100 grams rather than the current more than 10 but not more
  9 27 than 50 grams; or a class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not
  9 28 less than $1,000 but not more than $50,000 if the controlled
  9 29 substance containing cocaine base is 20 grams or less rather
  9 30 than the current 10 grams or less.
  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".

 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class

 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.

 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9  9    COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
  9 10 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
  9 11 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
  9 12 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
  9 13 or possesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a
  9 14 controlled substance containing cocaine base, or unlawfully
  9 15 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
  9 16 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  9 17 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  9 18 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  9 19 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  9 20 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100
  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  9 23 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a
  9 24 fine of not less than $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the
  9 25 controlled substance is more than 20 grams but not more than
  9 26 100 grams rather than the current more than 10 but not more
  9 27 than 50 grams; or a class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not
  9 28 less than $1,000 but not more than $50,000 if the controlled
  9 29 substance containing cocaine base is 20 grams or less rather
  9 30 than the current 10 grams or less.
  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 12 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
  9 13 or possesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a
  9 14 controlled substance containing cocaine base, or unlawfully
  9 15 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
  9 16 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  9 17 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  9 18 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  9 19 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  9 20 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100
  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  9 23 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a
  9 24 fine of not less than $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the
  9 25 controlled substance is more than 20 grams but not more than
  9 26 100 grams rather than the current more than 10 but not more
  9 27 than 50 grams; or a class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not

  9 29 substance containing cocaine base is 20 grams or less rather
  9 30 than the current 10 grams or less.
  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall

 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class

 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the

 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a

 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 10 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
  9 11 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
  9 12 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
  9 13 or possesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a
  9 14 controlled substance containing cocaine base, or unlawfully
  9 15 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
  9 16 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  9 17 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  9 18 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  9 19 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  9 20 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100
  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  9 23 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a
  9 24 fine of not less than $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the
  9 25 controlled substance is more than 20 grams but not more than
  9 26 100 grams rather than the current more than 10 but not more
  9 27 than 50 grams; or a class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not

  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for

  9 16 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  9 17 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  9 18 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  9 19 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  9 20 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100
  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  9 23 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a
  9 24 fine of not less than $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the

  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for

 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall

 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for

 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence

 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which

 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines

 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to

 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt

 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person

 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which

 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a

 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for

 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the

 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall

 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard

 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph

 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for

 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the

 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue

 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 21 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 100

  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 22 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"

  9 29 substance containing cocaine base is 20 grams or less rather

  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.

 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard

 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter

 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion

 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for

 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior

 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of

 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for

 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.

 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.

 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing

 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for

 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior

 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

  9 31    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES.  Under current law,
  9 32 a person serving a sentence for a conviction under Code
  9 33 section 124.401(1)(c) (class "C" felony, small quantity,
  9 34 drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession with intent to
  9 35 manufacture or deliver), shall not be required to serve a
 10  1 minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code sections
 10  2 124.413 and 902.12, if the person has not previously been
 10  3 convicted of a forcible felony and does not have a prior
 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a
 10  6 person serving a sentence under Code section 124.401(1)(c)
 10  7 serve the minimum term of confinement as prescribed by Code
 10  8 sections 124.413 and 902.12, even if the person has a prior
 10  9 forcible felony conviction or a prior conviction under section
 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change

 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department

 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

 10  4 conviction under Code section 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph
 10  5 "a", "b", or "c".  The bill strikes the requirement that a

 10 10 124.401, subsection 1, paragraph "a", "b", or "c".
 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.

 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard

 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall
 11  3 be interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
 11  4 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
 11  5    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
 11  6 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
 11  7 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
 11  8 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
 11  9 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
 11 16 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
 11 17    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
 11 18 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
 11 32    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
 12  4 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.
 12  5    RECONSIDERATION OF FELON'S SENTENCE.  The bill provides that
 12  6 from the date a person is convicted of a felony other than a
 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

 10 11    ATTEMPT TO COMMIT MURDER == PEACE OFFICER.  The bill defines
 10 12 "peace officer" to mean the same as defined in section 801.4.
 10 13    Under the bill, a person who attempts to commit murder
 10 14 against a peace officer in violation of Code section 707.11,
 10 15 with the knowledge that the person against whom the attempt to
 10 16 commit murder is committed is a peace officer, and while the
 10 17 officer is acting within the officer's official capacity, shall
 10 18 serve 100 percent of the term of confinement imposed and shall
 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement
 10 22 for no more than 25 years.  Currently, except for the attempt
 10 23 to commit murder against a peace officer in the bill, a person
 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for

 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall

 11 10 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
 11 11 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
 11 15 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the

 11 19 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
 11 23    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
 11 24 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
 11 25 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
 11 26 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
 11 27 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
 11 28 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
 11 29 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
 11 30    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
 11 31 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.

 11 33 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
 11 34 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
 11 35 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
 12  1 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
 12  2 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
 12  3 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in

 12  7 class "A" felony or class "B" felony, and the person begins to
 12  8 serve a sentence of confinement, the court on its own motion
 12  9 or on the recommendation of the director of the department
 12 10 of corrections, may order the person returned to the court,
 12 11 and resentence the person to any sentence permitted by law.
 12 12 Under current law, the reconsideration of a sentence option
 12 13 is not available to a person convicted of a class "A" felony
 12 14 or to a person serving a felony for which a minimum sentence
 12 15 of confinement is imposed.  Thus, the bill makes a person
 12 16 serving a class "B" felony ineligible for a reconsideration
 12 17 of a sentence but makes a person serving a felony for which
 12 18 a minimum sentence of confinement is imposed, eligible for
 12 19 reconsideration of the sentence.

 10 19 be denied parole, work release, or other early release.
 10 20    A person who commits attempt to commit murder commits a class
 10 21 "B" felony.  A class "B" felony is punishable by confinement

 10 24 who commits attempt to commit murder shall serve 70 percent of
 10 25 the sentence under Code section 902.12.
 10 26    After a person is sent to a correctional institution for
 10 27 an attempt to commit murder against a peace officer, the
 10 28 bill creates a new category "C" sentence which prohibits
 10 29 such a person from accumulating earned time that reduces the
 10 30 sentence of the person.  If a person is sentenced to serve
 10 31 both a category "C" sentence and another category sentence,
 10 32 the category "C" sentence shall be served before the other
 10 33 category sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue
 10 34 until the category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also
 10 35 provides that if an inmate serving a category sentence other
 11  1 than a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category
 11  2 "C" sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall

 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a

 11 12 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
 11 13 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
 11 14 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing

 11 20 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
 11 21 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
 11 22 the protection of the public.
