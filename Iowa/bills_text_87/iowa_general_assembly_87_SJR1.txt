  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the

  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal

  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund

  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as

  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the

  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue

  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue

  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or

  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.

  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.

  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills

  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes

  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the

  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new

  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure

  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor

  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.

  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.

  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three

  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment

  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue

  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.

  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the

  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the

  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or

  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.

  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in

  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not

  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and

  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall

  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure

  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes

  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the

  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or

  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills

  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general

  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular

  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference

  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal

  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or

  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a

  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.

  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.

  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:

  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular

  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference

  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure

  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or

  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.

  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and

  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or

  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.

  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.

  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the

  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or

  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes

  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:

  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure

  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.

  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the

  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund

  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.

  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.

  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the

  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The

  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of

  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by a revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.

  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the

  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.

  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current

  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund

  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a

  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.

  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure

  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.

  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as

  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.

  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.

  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  6 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  7 provided by law.
  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the
  1 28 state.
  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three

  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.

  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95

  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,

  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be

  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general fund
  2 16 due to new transfers to the general fund over and above those
  2 17 moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in effect
  2 18 as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the state
  2 19 revenue estimating conference. Except for transfers provided
  2 20 for by law, the revenue estimating conference shall determine
  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.
  3 33    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.

  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical

  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the

  4  1    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment
  4  2 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the
  4  3 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  5 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.

  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.

  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.

  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a

  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall

  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.

  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  2 21 whether transfers to the general fund are to be considered as
  2 22 new revenue in determining the state general fund expenditure
  2 23 limitation.
  2 24    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 25 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 26 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 27 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 28    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 29 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 30    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 34    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 35 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  3  1 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  3  2    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  3  3 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  3  4 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  5 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.

  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor

  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.

  4  8                           EXPLANATION
  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  2 31 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 32    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 33 revenue estimate for the general fund.

  3  6 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  7 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  8 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from
  3  9 the projected revenue from that source. If a new revenue
  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 26    8.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.

  3 34 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 35 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.

  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the

  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general

  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general

  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  3 10 source is established and implemented, the state general fund
  3 11 expenditure limitation amount calculated in subsection 3 shall
  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated

  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 22 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 23 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause
  3 24 the final budget approved by the governor to exceed the state
  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.

  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations

  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  4  4 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of

  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

  3 12 be recalculated to include ninety=five percent of the estimated
  3 13 revenue from that source that is attributed to the revenue
  3 14 estimate used to calculate the limitation amount.
  3 15    6.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 16 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 17 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 18 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 19    7.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 20 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 21 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or

  3 25 general fund expenditure limitation.

  3 27 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 28 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 29 included in the budget.
  3 30    9.  The state shall use consistent standards, in accordance
  3 31 with generally accepted accounting principles, for all state
  3 32 budgeting and accounting purposes.

  4  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 11    This resolution proposes an amendment establishing a new
  4 12 Article to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that relates
  4 13 to state budgets and state revenue.
  4 14    The amendment creates a state general fund expenditure
  4 15 limitation. The amount of the limitation is the lesser of
  4 16 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the general
  4 17 fund of the state for the following fiscal year or 104 percent
  4 18 of the net revenue estimate for the general fund for the
  4 19 current fiscal year. The amendment defines adjusted revenue
  4 20 estimate and net revenue estimate and requires that the
  4 21 estimates be determined by a revenue estimating conference
  4 22 which is to be created by the general assembly by law. The
  4 23 expenditure limitation is required to be used by the governor
  4 24 in preparation of the governor's budget and by the general
  4 25 assembly in the budget process. The governor is prohibited
  4 26 from approving or disapproving of appropriations in a manner
  4 27 that would cause the final budget approved by the governor to
  4 28 exceed the expenditure limitation.
  4 29    If a new revenue source is established and implemented, 95
  4 30 percent of the estimate of that new revenue shall be included
  4 31 in the revenue estimate used to calculate the expenditure
  4 32 limitation.
  4 33    The amendment also requires the state to use generally
  4 34 accepted accounting principles for state budgeting and
  4 35 accounting purposes. The amendment provides that the general
  5  1 assembly shall enact laws to implement the amendment.
  5  2    The joint resolution, if adopted, will be referred to the
  5  3 next general assembly for adoption a second time in identical
  5  4 form before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.
