  2 26 state action burdens a person's exercise of religion.
  2 27    Under current law, a court is not required to apply
  2 28 heightened scrutiny when reviewing a law that burdens a
  2 29 person's exercise of religion when such law is generally
  2 30 applicable.  The bill provides that a court shall apply
  2 31 heightened scrutiny in such cases, so that state action cannot
  2 32 substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it
  2 33 is demonstrated that applying the law of general applicability
  2 34 is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is
  2 35 the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. The
  3  1 bill provides that a person whose exercise of religion has been
  3  2 burdened by state action may assert such violation as a claim
  3  3 or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
  3  4    The bill does not apply to the department of corrections, a
  3  5 district department of correctional services, a county jail, or
  3  6 other detention facility.
